> Our [calculator](https://offset.climateneutralnow.org/footprintcalc) estimates household emissions based on the latest country specific data available to us. All data has been obtained from external and reliable sources (EDGAR, EPA, Climate Watch, ICAO and other organizations). This data is complemented by internal estimations made by our experts. We use different means to check the credibility of the data and to ensure highest possible degree of accuracy before we subject it to the algorithms we developed for this calculator.
> 
> The greenhouse gas emissions associated with different activities are recalculated in CO2 equivalent to produce a uniform result. To make it easier for you to complete the calculations, in certain instances we use default values. Make sure to adjust those according to your circumstances.
> 
> For the final calculation, in addition to the data you provide, we apply country-specific reference values for public services and for activities for which you do not know your footprint. Therefore, all three emissions categories: household, transport and lifestyle will be present with some proportion in your final result and the sum of their individual footprint may be different from the final result.

> We will be updating the data behind the calculator as much as possible over time.
