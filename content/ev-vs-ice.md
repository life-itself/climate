Reading this [Journal of Economic Perspectives 2016 article](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.30.1.117) which implies break-even cost at $115 barrel of oil is battery cost of $125.

Checking current battery cost implies getting very close to this, see e.g. www.energy-storage.news/bloombergnef-average-battery-pack-prices-to-drop-below-us100-kwh-by-2024-despite-near-term-spikes/

> Supply chain shocks are causing short-term rises in the price of lithium-ion battery packs, but overall the price trend is downward and by 2024 average prices could dip below US$100/kWh.
