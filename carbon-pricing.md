Remarkably, all 13 authors agree with the core principle of the book — that a common international commitment to carbon pricing can reduce the free-rider problem and help protect nations that cooperate. In fact, the book’s major argument for global carbon pricing is not economic efficiency (still a good reason), but rather that it fosters cooperation.
