Economic facts vary, however, and in April 2007 the estimated cost of offshore was up to \\xA392 per MWh (Dept. of Trade and Industry, 2007, p7). By April 2008, the price of offshore wind evidently went even higher: Shell pulled out of their commitment to build the London Array. It\\u2019s because offshore wind is so expensive that the Government is having to increase the number of ROCs (renewable obligation certificates) per unit of offshore wind energy. The ROC is the unit of subsidy given out to certain forms of renewable electricity generation. The standard value of a ROC is \\xA345, with 1 ROC per MWh; so with a wholesale price of roughly \\xA340/MWh, renewable generators are getting paid \\xA385 per MWh. So 1 ROC per MWh is not enough subsidy to cover the cost of \\xA392 per MWh. In the same document, estimates for other renewables (medium levelized costs in 2010) are as follows. Onshore wind: \\xA365\\u201389/MWh; co-firing of biomass: \\xA353/MWh; large-scale hydro: \\xA363/MWh; sewage gas: \\xA338/MWh; solar PV: \\xA3571/MWh; wave: \\xA3196/MWh; tide: \\xA3177/MWh. \\u201CDale Vince, chief executive of green energy provider Ecotricity, which is engaged in building onshore wind farms, said that he supported the Government\\u2019s \",\"[offshore wind]\",\" plans, but only if they are not to the detriment of onshore wind. \\u2018It\\u2019s dangerous to overlook the fantastic resource we have in this country\\u2026 By our estimates, it will cost somewhere in the region of \\xA340bn to build the 33 GW of offshore power Hutton is proposing.
