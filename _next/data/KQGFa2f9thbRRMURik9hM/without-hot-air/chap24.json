Our knowledge of geology is such that we can be confident that identified resources of metal minerals are a small fraction of what is there. \\u201CMeasured resources of uranium, the amount known to be economically recoverable from orebodies, are \\u2026 dependent on the intensity of past exploration effort, and are basically a statement about what is known rather than what is there in the Earth\\u2019s crust. \\u201CThe world\\u2019s present measured resources of uranium (5.5 Mt) \\u2026 are enough to last for over 80 years. This represents a higher level of assured resources than is normal for most minerals. Further exploration and higher prices will certainly, on the basis of present geological knowledge, yield further resources as present ones are used up.\\u201D \\u201CEconomically rational players will only invest in finding these new reserves when they are most confident of gaining a return from them, which usually requires positive price messages caused by undersupply trends. If the economic system is working correctly and maximizing capital efficiency, there should never be more than a few decades of any resource commodity in reserves at any point in time.\\u201D \",\"[Exploration has a cost; exploring for uranium, for example, has had a cost of $1\\u2013$1.50 per kg of uranium ($3.4/MJ), which is 2% of the spot price of $78/kgU; in contrast, the finding costs of crude oil have averaged around $6/barrel ($1050/MJ) (12% of the spot price) over at least the past three decades.]\",\" \\u201CUnlike the metals which have been in demand for centuries, society has barely begun to utilize uranium.

See also Jones (1984). These death rates are from studies that are predicting the future. We can also look in the past. In Britain, nuclear power has generated 200 GWy of electricity, and the nuclear industry has had 1 fatality, a worker who died at Chapelcross in 1978 [\",mdx(\"a\",e({parentName:\"li\"},{href:\"http://tinyurl.com/4f2ekz\"}),mdx(\"span\",{class:\"websitetitle\"},\"4f2ekz\")),\"]. One death per 200 GWy is an impressively low death rate compared with the fossil fuel industry. Worldwide, the nuclear-power historical death rate is hard to estimate. The Three Mile Island meltdown killed no-one, and the associated leaks are estimated to have perhaps killed one person in the time since the accident. The accident at Chernobyl first killed 62 who died directly from exposure, and 15 local people who died later of thyroid cancer; it\\u2019s estimated that nearby, another 4000 died of cancer, and that worldwide, about 5000 people (among 7 million who were exposed to fallout) died of cancer because of Chernobyl (Williams and Baverstock, 2006); but these deaths are impossible to detect because cancers, many of them caused by natural nuclear radiation, already cause 25% of deaths in Europe. One way to estimate a global death rate from nuclear power worldwide is to divide this estimate of Chernobyl\\u2019s deathtoll (9000 deaths) by the cumulative output of nuclear power from 1969 to 1996, which was 3685 GWy. This gives a death rate of 2.4 deaths per GWy.

In the mid-1990s the mortality rate associated with wind power was 3.5 deaths per GWy.
