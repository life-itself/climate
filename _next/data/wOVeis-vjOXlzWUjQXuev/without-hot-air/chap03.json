When looking up calorific values, you\\u2019ll find \"gross calorific value\" and \"net calorific value\" listed (also known as \"high heat value\" and \"low heat value\"). These differ by only 6% for motor fuels, so it\\u2019s not crucial to distinguish them here, but let me explain anyway. The gross calorific value is the actual chemical energy released when the fuel is burned. One of the products of combustion is water, and in most engines and power stations, part of the energy goes into vaporizing this water. The net calorific value measures how much energy is left over assuming this energy of vaporization is discarded and wasted. When we ask \"how much energy does my lifestyle consume?\" the gross calorific value is the right quantity to use. The net calorific value, on the other hand, is of interest to a power station engineer, who needs to decide which fuel to burn in his power station. Throughout this book I\\u2019ve tried to use gross calorific values. A final note for party-pooping pedants who say \"butter is not a hydrocarbon\": OK, butter is not a pure hydrocarbon; but it\\u2019s a good approximation to say that the main component of butter is long hydrocarbon chains, just like petrol. The proof of the pudding is, this approximation got us within 30% of the correct answer.
