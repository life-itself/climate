Source: MacLeay et al. (2007). In 2006, large-scale hydro produced 3515 GWh (from plant with a capacity of 1.37 GW); small-scale hydro, 212 GWh (0.01 kWh/d/p) (from a capacity of 153 MW).

The 20fold exaggeration is achieved by focusing on Glendoe\\u2019s peak output rather than its average, which is 5 times smaller; and by discussing \"homes\" rather than the total electrical power of Glasgow (see p329).',mdx(\"a\",e({parentName:\"li\"},{href:\"#fnref-3\",className:\"footnote-backref\"}),\"\\u21A9\")))))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n","scope":{}},"frontMatter":{}},"__N_SSG":true}
