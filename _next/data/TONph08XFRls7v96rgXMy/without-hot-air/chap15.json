A more recent full life-cycle analysis (Denison, 1997) estimates the net energy cost of production of newsprint in the USA from virgin wood followed by a typical mix of landfilling and incineration to be 12 kWh/kg; the energy cost of producing newsprint from recycled material and recycling it is 6 kWh/kg.\",mdx(\"a\",e({parentName:\"li\"},{href:\"#fnref-7\",className:\"footnote-backref\"}),\"\\u21A9\")),mdx(\"li\",e({parentName:\"ol\"},{id:\"fn-8\"}),mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"li\"},\"A new car\\u2019s embodied energy is 76 000 kWh\"),\".
