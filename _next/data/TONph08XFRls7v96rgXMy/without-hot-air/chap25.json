Power is extracted from the air-flow by turbines at the base of the chimney. Solar chimneys are fairly simple to build, but they don\\u2019t deliver a very impressive power per unit area. A pilot plant in Manzanares, Spain operated for seven years between 1982 and 1989. The chimney had a height of 195 m and a diameter of 10 m; the collector had a diameter of 240 m, and its roof had 6000 m\",mdx(\"sup\",null,\"2\"),\" of glass and 40 000 m\",mdx(\"sup\",null,\"2\"),\" of transparent plastic.
