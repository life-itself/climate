It\\u2019s not necessary to dig big holes in the garden and install underfloor heating to get the benefits of heat pumps; the best air-source heat pumps (which require just a small external box, like an air-conditioner\\u2019s) can deliver hot water to normal radiators with a coefficient of performance above 3.
