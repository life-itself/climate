The theoretical limit for a standard \\u201Csingle-junction\\u201D solar panel without concentrators, the Shockley\\u2013Queisser limit, says that at most 31% of the energy in sunlight can be converted to electricity (Shockley and Queisser, 1961). (The main reason for this limit is that a standard solar material has a property called its band-gap, which defines a particular energy of photon that that material converts most efficiently. Sunlight contains photons with many energies; photons with energy \",mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"li\"},\"below\"),\" the band-gap are not used at all; photons with energy \",mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"li\"},\"greater\"),\" than the band-gap may be captured, but all their energy in excess of the band-gap is lost.) Concentrators (lenses or mirrors) can both reduce the cost (per watt) of photovoltaic systems, and increase their efficiency. The Shockley\\u2013Queisser limit for solar panels with concentrators is 41% efficiency. The only way to beat the Shockley\\u2013Queisser limit is to make fancy photovoltaic devices that split the light into different wavelengths, processing each wavelength-range with its own personalized band-gap.
