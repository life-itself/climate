I learnt a brilliant way to automate congestion-charging from Stephen Salter. A simple daily congestion charge, as levied in London, sends only a crude signal to drivers; once a car-owner has decided to pay the day\\u2019s charge and drive into a congestion zone, he has no incentive to drive \",mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"li\"},\"little\"),\" in the zone. Nor is he rewarded with any rebate if he carefully chooses routes in the zone that are not congested. Instead of having a centralized authority that decides in advance when and where the congestion-charge zones are, with expensive and intrusive monitoring and recording of vehicle movements into and within all those zones, Salter has a simpler, decentralized, anonymous method of charging drivers for driving in heavy, slow traffic, wherever and whenever it actually exists. The system would operate nationwide. Here\\u2019s how it works. We want a device that answers the question \\u201Chow congested is the traffic I am driving in?\\u201D A good measure of congestion is \\u201Chow many other active vehicles are close to mine?\\u201D In fast-moving traffic, the spacing between vehicles is larger than slow-moving traffic. Traffic that\\u2019s trundling in tedious queues is the most densely packed. The number of nearby vehicles that are active can be sensed anonymously by fitting in every vehicle a radio transmitter/receiver (like a very cheap mobile phone) that transmits little radio-bleeps at a steady rate whenever the engine is running, and that counts the number of bleeps it hears from other vehicles. The congestion charge would be proportional to the number of bleeps received; this charge could be paid at refuelling stations whenever the vehicle is refuelled. The radio transmitter/receiver would replace the current UK road tax disc.\",mdx(\"a\",e({parentName:\"li\"},{href:\"#fnref-9\",className:\"footnote-backref\"}),\"\\u21A9\")),mdx(\"li\",e({parentName:\"ol\"},{id:\"fn-10\"}),mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"li\"},\"hydraulics and flywheels salvage at least 70% of the braking energy\"),\".
