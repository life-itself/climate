When the wave rushes round the stadium, the humans who are making the wave aren\\u2019t themselves moving round the stadium: they just bob up and down a little. The motion of a piece of water in the ocean is similar: if you focused on a bit of seaweed floating in the water as waves go by, you\\u2019d see that the seaweed moves up and down, and also a little to and fro in the direction of travel of the wave \\u2013 the exact effect could be recreated in a Mexican wave if people moved like window-cleaners, polishing a big piece of glass in a circular motion.
