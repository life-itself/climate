id="30-energy-plans-for-europe-america-and-the-world">30 Energy plans for Europe, America, and the World</h1><p>Figure 30.1 shows the power consumptions of lots of countries or regions, versus their gross domestic products (GDPs). It is a widely held assumption that human development and growth are good things, so when sketching world plans for sustainable energy I am going to assume that all the countries with low GDP per capita are going to progress rightwards in figure 30.1. And as their GDPs increase, it‚Äôs inevitable that their power consumptions will increase too. It‚Äôs not clear what consumption we should plan for, but I think that the average European level (125 kWh per day per person) seems a reasonable assumption; alternatively, we could assume that efficiency measures, like those envisaged in Cartoon Britain in Chapters 19‚Äì28, allow all countries to attain a European standard of living with a lower power consumption. In the consumption plan in <a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="../Text/chap27.xhtml#fig27.1">chapter 27</a>, Cartoon Britain‚Äôs consumption fell to about <span class="red">68 kWh/d/p</span>. Bearing in mind that Cartoon Britain doesn‚Äôt have much industrial activity, perhaps it would be sensible to assume a slightly higher target, such as Hong Kong‚Äôs <span class="red">80 kWh/d/p</span>.</p><span id="fig30.1"></span>![](/img/without-hot-air/figure242.gif)<span class="figurenumber">Figure 30.1.</span> Power consumption per capita versus GDP per capita, in purchasing-power-parity US dollars. Data from UNDP Human Development Report, 2007. Squares show countries having &quot;high human development;&quot; circles, &quot;medium&quot; or &quot;low.&quot; Both variables are on logarithmic scales. [Figure 18.4](../Text/chap18.xhtml#fig18.4) shows the same data on normal scales.<h2 id="redoing-the-calculations-for-europe">Redoing the calculations for Europe</h2><p>Can Europe live on renewables?</p><p>Europe‚Äôs average population density is roughly half of Britain‚Äôs, so there is more land area in which to put enormous renewable facilities. The area of the European Union is roughly <span class="darkblue">9000 m<sup>2</sup></span> per person. However, many of the renewables have lower power density in Europe than in Britain: most of Europe has less wind, less wave, and less tide. Some parts do have more hydro (in Scandinavia and Central Europe); and some have more solar. Let‚Äôs work out some rough numbers.</p><h3 id="wind">Wind</h3><p>The heart of continental Europe has lower typical windspeeds than the British Isles ‚Äì in much of Italy, for example, windspeeds are below 4 m/s. Let‚Äôs guess that one fifth of Europe has big enough wind-speeds for economical wind-farms, having a power density of 2 W/m<sup>2</sup>, and then assume that we give those regions the same treatment we gave Britain in Chapter 4, filling 10% of them with wind farms. The area of the European Union is roughly 9000 m<sup>2</sup> per person. So wind gives</p><p>[\frac{\text{1}}{\text{5}}\  \times \text{10\%~} \times \text{~9000~}\text{m}^{\text{2}}\  \times \text{~2\ W/}\text{m}^{\text{2}}\  = \text{~360\ W}]</p><p>which is <span class="green">9 kWh/d per person</span>.</p><h3 id="hydroelectricity">Hydroelectricity</h3><p>Hydroelectric production in Europe totals 590 TWh/y, or 67 GW; shared between 500 million, that‚Äôs 3.2 kWh/d per person. This production is dominated by Norway, France, Sweden, Italy, Austria, and Switzerland. If every country doubled its hydroelectric facilities ‚Äì which I think would be difficult ‚Äì then hydro would give <span class="green">6.4 kWh/d per person</span>.</p><h3 id="wave">Wave</h3><p>Taking the whole Atlantic coastline (about 4000 km) and multiplying by an assumed average production rate of 10 kW/m, we get <span class="green">2 kWh/d per person</span>. The Baltic and Mediterranean coastlines have no wave resource worth talking of.</p><h3 id="tide">Tide</h3><p>Doubling the estimated total resource around the British Isles (11 kWh/d per person, from Chapter 14) to allow for French, Irish and Norwegian tidal resources, then sharing between a population of 500 million, we get <span class="green">2.6 kWh/d per person</span>. The Baltic and Mediterranean coastlines have no tidal resource worth talking of.</p><h3 id="solar-photovoltaics-and-thermal-panels-on-roofs">Solar photovoltaics and thermal panels on roofs</h3><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure243.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 30.2.</span> A solar water heater providing hot water for a family in Michigan. The system‚Äôs pump is powered by the small photovoltaic panel on the left.<p>Most places are sunnier than the UK, so solar panels would deliver more power in continental Europe. 10 m<sup>2</sup> of roof-mounted photovoltaic panels would deliver about 7 kWh/d in all places south of the UK. Similarly, 2 m<sup>2</sup> of water-heating panels could deliver on average 3.6 kWh/d of low-grade thermal heat. (I don‚Äôt see much point in suggesting having more than 2 m<sup>2</sup> per person of water-heating panels, since this capacity would already be enough to saturate typical demand for hot water.)</p><h3 id="what-else">What else?</h3><p>The total so far is 9 + 6.4 + 2 + 2.6 + 7 + 3.6 = 30.6 kWh/d per person. The only resources not mentioned so far are geothermal power, and large-scale solar farming (with mirrors, panels, or biomass).</p><p>Geothermal power might work, but it‚Äôs still in the research stages. I suggest treating it like fusion power: a good investment, but not to be relied on.</p><p>So what about solar farming? We could imagine using 5% of Europe (450 m<sup>2</sup> per person) for solar photovoltaic farms like the Bavarian one in figure 6.7 (which has a power density of 5 W/m<sup>2</sup>). This would deliver an average power of</p><p>5 W/m<sup>2</sup> √ó 450 m<sup>2</sup> = <span class="green">54 kWh/d per person</span>.</p><p>Solar PV farming would, therefore, add up to something substantial. The main problem with photovoltaic panels is their cost. Getting power during the winter is also a concern<!-- -->!</p><p>Energy crops? Plants capture only 0.5 W/m<sup>2</sup> (figure 6.11). Given that Europe needs to feed itself, the non-food energy contribution from plants in Europe can never be enormous. Yes, there will be some oil-seed rape here and some forestry there, but I don‚Äôt imagine that the total non-food contribution of plants could be more than <span class="green">12 kWh/d per person</span>.</p><h3 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h3><p>Let‚Äôs be realistic. Just like Britain, <em>Europe can‚Äôt live on its own renewables</em>. So if the aim is to get off fossil fuels, Europe needs nuclear power, or solar power in other people‚Äôs deserts (as discussed on p179), or both.</p><h2 id="redoing-the-calculations-for-north-america">Redoing the calculations for North America</h2><p>The average American uses 250 kWh per day. Can we hit that target with renewables? What if we imagine imposing shocking efficiency measures (such as efficient cars and high-speed electric trains) such that Americans were reduced to the misery of living on the mere 125 kWh/d of an average European or Japanese citizen?</p><h3 id="wind-1">Wind</h3><p>A study by Elliott et al. (1991) assessed the wind energy potential of the USA. The windiest spots are in North Dakota, Wyoming, and Montana. They reckoned that, over the whole country, 435 000 km<sup>2</sup> of windy land could be exploited without raising too many hackles, and that the electricity generated would be 4600 TWh per year, which is <span class="green">42 kWh per day per person</span> if shared between 300 million people. Their calculations assumed an average power density of 1.2 W/m<sup>2</sup>, incidentally ‚Äì smaller than the 2 W/m<sup>2</sup> we assumed in Chapter 4. The area of these wind farms, 435 000 km<sup>2</sup>, is roughly the same as the area of California. The amount of wind hardware required (assuming a load factor of 20%) would be a capacity of about 2600 GW, which would be a 200-fold increase in wind hardware in the USA.</p><h3 id="offshore-wind">Offshore wind</h3><p>If we assume that shallow offshore waters with an area equal to the sum of Delaware and Connecticut (20 000 km<sup>2</sup>, a substantial chunk of all shallow waters on the east coast of the USA) are filled with offshore wind farms having a power density of 3 W/m<sup>2</sup>, we obtain an average power of 60 GW. That‚Äôs <span class="green">4.8 kWh/d per person</span> if shared between 300 million people. The wind hardware required would be 15 times the total wind hardware currently in the USA. <sup id="fnref-1"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap30/#fn-1">1</a></sup></p><h3 id="span-idgeothermalgeothermalspan"><span id="geothermal">Geothermal</span></h3><p>I mentioned the MIT geothermal energy study (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2006) in Chapter 16. The authors are upbeat about the potential of geothermal energy in North America, especially in the western states where there is more hotter rock. ‚ÄúWith a reasonable investment in R\&amp;D, enhanced geothermal systems could provide 100 GW(e) or more of cost-competitive generating capacity in the next 50 years. Further, enhanced geothermal systems provide a secure source of power for the long term.‚Äù Let‚Äôs assume they are right. 100 GW of electricity is <span class="green">8 kWh/d per person</span> when shared between 300 million.</p><h3 id="hydro">Hydro</h3><p>The hydroelectric facilities of Canada, the USA, and Mexico generate about 660 TWh per year. Shared between 500 million people, that amounts to 3.6 kWh/d per person. Could the hydroelectric output of North America be doubled? If so, hydro would provide <span class="green">7.2 kWh/d per person</span>.</p><h3 id="what-else-1">What else?</h3><p>The total so far is 42 + 4.8 + 8 + 7.2 = 62 kWh/d per person. Not enough for even a European existence<!-- -->!<!-- --> I could discuss various other options such as the sustainable burning of Canadian forests in power stations. But rather than prolong the agony, let‚Äôs go immediately for a technology that adds up: concentrating solar power.</p><p>Figure 30.3 shows the area within North America that would provide everyone there (500 million people) with an average power of <span class="green">250 kWh/d</span>.</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure244.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 30.3.</span> The little square strikes again. The 600 km by 600 km square in North America, completely filled with concentrating solar power, would provide enough power to give 500 million people the average American‚Äôs consumption of 250 kWh/d.  This map also shows the square of size 600 km by 600 km in Africa, which we met earlier. I‚Äôve assumed a power density of 15 W/m<sup>2</sup>, as before.  The area of one yellow square is a little bigger than the area of Arizona, and 16 times the area of New Jersey. Within each big square is a smaller 145 km by 145 km square showing the area required in the desert ‚Äì one New Jersey ‚Äì to supply 30 million people with 250 kWh per day per person.<h3 id="the-bottom-line-1">The bottom line</h3><p>North America‚Äôs <em>non-solar</em> renewables aren‚Äôt enough for North America to live on. But when we include a massive expansion of solar power, there‚Äôs enough. So North America needs solar in its own deserts, or nuclear power, or both. <sup id="fnref-2"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap30/#fn-2">2</a></sup></p><h2 id="redoing-the-calculations-for-the-world">Redoing the calculations for the world</h2><p>How can 6 billion people obtain the power for a European standard of living ‚Äì 80 kWh per day per person, say?</p><h3 id="wind-2">Wind</h3><p>The exceptional spots in the world with strong steady winds are the central states of the USA (Kansas, Oklahoma); Saskatchewan, Canada; the southern extremities of Argentina and Chile; northeast Australia; northeast and northwest China; northwest Sudan; southwest South Africa; Somalia; Iran; and Afghanistan.
