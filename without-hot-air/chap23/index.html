A caterpillar grazing on old leaves. Photo by Peter Gunn.<p>Our conclusion is clear:</p><blockquote><p><em>Clean coal is only a stop-gap.</em></p></blockquote><p>If we do develop ‚Äúclean coal‚Äù technology in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we must be careful, while patting ourselves on the back, to do the accounting honestly. The coal-burning process releases greenhouse gases not only at the power station but also at the coal mine. <sup id="fnref-5"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap23/#fn-5">5</a></sup> Coal-mining tends to release methane, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide, both directly from the coal seams as they are exposed, and subsequently from discarded shales and mudstones; for an ordinary coal power station, these coal-mine emissions bump up the greenhouse gas footprint by about 2%, so for a ‚Äúclean‚Äù coal power station, these emissions may have some impact on the accounts. There‚Äôs a similar accounting problem with natural gas: if, say, 5% of the natural gas leaks out along the journey from hole in the ground to power station, then this accidental methane pollution is equivalent (in greenhouse effect) to a 40% boost in the carbon dioxide released at the power station. <sup id="fnref-6"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap23/#fn-6">6</a></sup></p><h2 id="new-coal-technologies">New coal technologies</h2><p>Stanford-based company <a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="http://www.directcarbon.com/"><span class="websitetitle">www.directcarbon.com</span></a> are developing the <em>Direct Carbon Fuel Cell</em>, which converts fuel and air directly to electricity and CO<sub>2</sub>, without involving any water or steam turbines. They claim that this way of generating electricity from coal is twice as efficient as the standard power station.</p><h2 id="whens-the-end-of-business-as-usual">When‚Äôs the end of business as usual?</h2><p>The economist Jevons did a simple calculation in 1865. People were discussing how long British coal would last. They tended to answer this question by dividing the estimated coal remaining by the rate of coal consumption, getting answers like ‚Äú1000 years.‚Äù But, Jevons said, consumption is <em>not</em> constant. It‚Äôs been doubling every 20 years, and ‚Äúprogress‚Äù would have it continue to do so. So ‚Äúreserves divided by consumption-rate‚Äù gives the wrong answer.</p><p>Instead, Jevons extrapolated the exponentially-growing consumption, calculating the time by which the total amount consumed would exceed the estimated reserves. This was a much shorter time. Jevons was not assuming that consumption would actually continue to grow at the same rate; rather he was making the point that growth was not sustainable. His calculation estimated for his British readership the inevitable limits to their growth, and the short time remaining before those limits would become evident. Jevons made the bold prediction that the end of British ‚Äúprogress‚Äù would come within 100 years of 1865. Jevons was right. British coal production peaked in 1910, and by 1965 Britain was no longer a world superpower.</p><p>Let‚Äôs repeat his calculation for the world as a whole. In 2006, the coal consumption rate was 6.3 Gt per year. Comparing this with reserves of 1600 Gt of coal, people often say ‚Äúthere‚Äôs 250 years of coal left.‚Äù But if we assume ‚Äúbusiness as usual‚Äù implies a growing consumption, we get a different answer. If the growth rate of coal consumption were to continue at 2% per year (which gives a reasonable fit to the data from 1930 to 2000), then all the coal would be gone in 2096. If the growth rate is 3.4% per year (the growth rate over the last decade), the end of business-as-usual is coming before 2072. Not 250 years, but 60<!-- -->!</p><p>If Jevons were here today, I am sure he would firmly predict that unless we steer ourselves on a course different from business as usual, there will, by 2050 or 2060, be an end to our happy progressive condition.</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure433.gif"/></p><h2 id="notes-and-further-reading">Notes and further reading</h2><p>The average methane content in British coal seams is 4.7 m<sup>3</sup> per ton of coal (Jackson and Kershaw, 1996); this methane, if released to the atmosphere, has a global warming potential about 5% of that of the CO<sub>2</sub> from burning the coal.</p><p>Further reading: World Energy Council [<a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="http://tinyurl.com/yhxf8b"><span class="websitetitle">yhxf8b</span></a>]</p><p>Further reading about underground coal gasification: [<a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="http://tinyurl.com/e2m9n"><span class="websitetitle">e2m9n</span></a>]</p><div class="footnotes"><hr/><ol><li id="fn-1"><em>1000 years ‚Äì my arbitrary definition of ‚Äúsustainable.‚Äù</em> As precedent for this sort of choice, Hansen et al.

Jevons made the bold prediction that the end of British \\u201Cprogress\\u201D would come within 100 years of 1865. Jevons was right.
