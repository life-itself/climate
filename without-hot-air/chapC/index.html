less.</em></p><p>Tony Blair</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>Hoping for the best is not a policy, it is a delusion.</em></p><p>Emily Armistead, Greenpeace</p></blockquote><p>What are the fundamental limits of travel by flying? Does the physics of flight require an unavoidable use of a certain amount of energy, per ton, per kilometre flown? What‚Äôs the maximum distance a 300-ton Boeing 747 can fly? What about a 1-kg bar-tailed godwit or a 100-gram Arctic tern?</p><p>Just as Chapter 3, in which we estimated consumption by cars, was followed by Chapter A, offering a model of where the energy goes in cars, this chapter fills out Chapter 5, discussing where the energy goes in planes. The only physics required is Newton‚Äôs laws of motion, which I‚Äôll describe when they‚Äôre needed.</p><p>This discussion will allow us to answer questions such as ‚Äúwould air travel consume much less energy if we travelled in slower propellor-driven planes?‚Äù There‚Äôs a lot of equations ahead: I hope you enjoy them<!-- -->!</p><h2 id="how-to-fly">How to fly</h2><p>Planes (and birds) move through air, so, just like cars and trains, they experience a drag force, and much of the energy guzzled by a plane goes into pushing the plane along against this force. Additionally, unlike cars and trains, planes have to expend energy <em>in order to stay up</em>.</p><p>Planes stay up by throwing air down. When the plane pushes down on air, the air pushes up on the plane (because Newton‚Äôs third law tells it to). As long as this upward push, which is called lift, is big enough to balance the downward weight of the plane, the plane avoids plummeting downwards.</p><p>When the plane throws air down, it gives that air kinetic energy. So creating lift requires energy. The total power required by the plane is the sum of the power required to create lift and the power required to overcome ordinary drag. (The power required to create lift is usually called ‚Äúinduced drag,‚Äù by the way. But I‚Äôll call it the lift power, <em>P</em><span class="smallfont1"><sub>lift</sub></span>.)</p><p>The two equations we‚Äôll need, in order to work out a theory of flight, are Newton‚Äôs second law:</p><p>[\begin{matrix}
{\text{force} = \text{rate\ of\ change\ of\ momentum}} <!-- -->\<!-- -->
\end{matrix}]</p><p>and Newton‚Äôs third law, which I just mentioned:</p><p>[\begin{matrix}
{\text{force\ exerted\ on\ A\ by\ B} = \text{-\ force\ exerted\ on\ B\ by\ A}} <!-- -->\<!-- -->
\end{matrix}]</p><p>If you don‚Äôt like equations, I can tell you the punchline now: we‚Äôre going to find that the power required to create lift turns out to be <em>equal</em> to the power required to overcome drag. So the requirement to ‚Äústay up‚Äù <em>doubles</em> the power required.</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure271.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure C.2.</span> A plane encounters a stationary tube of air. Once the plane has passed by, the air has been thrown downwards by the plane. The force exerted by the plane on the air to accelerate it downwards is equal and opposite to the upwards force exerted on the plane by the air.<p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure272.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure C.3.</span> Our cartoon assumes that the plane leaves a sausage of air moving down in its wake. A realistic picture involves a more complex swirling flow. For the real thing, see figure C.4.<p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure274.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure C.4.</span> Air flow behind a plane. Photo by NASA Langley Research Center.<p>Let‚Äôs make a cartoon of the lift force on a plane moving at speed <em>v</em>. In a time <em>t</em> the plane moves a distance <em>vt</em> and leaves behind it a sausage of downward-moving air (figure C.2). We‚Äôll call the cross-sectional area of this sausage <em>A</em><span class="smallfont1"><sub>s</sub></span>. This sausage‚Äôs diameter is roughly equal to the wingspan <em>w</em> of the plane. (Within this large sausage is a smaller sausage of swirling turbulent air with cross-sectional area similar to the frontal area of the plane‚Äôs body.) Actually, the details of the air flow are much more interesting than this sausage picture: each wing tip leaves behind it a vortex, with the air between the wingtips moving down fast, and the air beyond (outside) the wingtips moving up (figures C.3 &amp; C.4). This upward-moving air is exploited by birds flying in formation: just behind the tip of a bird‚Äôs wing is a sweet little updraft. Anyway, let‚Äôs get back to our sausage.</p><p>The sausage‚Äôs mass is</p><p>[\begin{matrix}
{m<em>{\text{sausage}} = \text{density} \times \text{volume} = \rho vtA</em>{\text{s}}\text{.}} <!-- -->\<!-- -->
\end{matrix}]</p><p>Let‚Äôs say the whole sausage is moving down with speed <em>u</em>, and figure out what <em>u</em> needs to be in order for the plane to experience a lift force equal to its weight mg. The downward momentum of the sausage created in time t is</p><p>[\begin{matrix}
{{\text{mass} \times \text{velocity} = m}<em>{\text{sausage}}u = \rho vtA</em>{\text{s}}u\text{.}} <!-- -->\<!-- -->
\end{matrix}]</p><p>And by Newton‚Äôs laws this must equal the momentum delivered by the plane‚Äôs weight in time <em>t</em>, namely,</p><p>[\begin{matrix}

\end{matrix}]</p><p>Rearranging this equation,</p><p>[\begin{matrix}

\end{matrix}]</p><p>we can solve for the required downward sausage speed,</p><p>[u = \frac{mg}{\rho vA_{\text{s}}}\text{.}]</p><p>Interesting<!-- -->!<!-- --> The sausage speed is <em>inversely</em> related to the plane‚Äôs speed <em>v</em>. A slow-moving plane has to throw down air harder than a fast-moving plane, because it encounters less air per unit time. That‚Äôs why landing planes, travelling slowly, have to extend their flaps: so as to create a larger and steeper wing that deflects air more.</p><p>What‚Äôs the energetic cost of pushing the sausage down at the required speed <em>u</em>? The power required is</p><p>[\begin{matrix}

\end{matrix}]</p><p>This energy-per-distance is fairly complicated; but it simplifies greatly if we assume that the plane is <em>designed</em> to fly at the speed that <em>minimizes</em> the energy-per-distance. The energy-per-distance, you see, has got a sweetspot as a function of <em>v</em> (figure C.5). The sum of the two quantities <!-- -->(<!-- -->\frac{1}{2}c<em>{\text{d}}\rho A</em>{\text{p}}v^{2}<!-- -->)<!-- --> and <!-- -->(<!-- -->\frac{1}{2}{\left( mg \right)^{2}/\left( \rho v^{2}A_{\text{s}} \right)}<!-- -->)<!-- --> is smallest when the two quantities are equal. This phenomenon is delightfully common in physics and engineering: two things that don‚Äôt obviously <em>have</em> to be equal <em>are</em> actually equal, or equal within a factor of 2.</p><p>So, this equality principle tells us that the optimum speed for the plane is such that</p><p>[\begin{matrix}

\end{matrix}]</p><p>This defines the optimum speed if our cartoon of flight is accurate; the cartoon breaks down if the engine efficiency <em>Œµ</em> depends significantly on speed, or if the speed of the plane exceeds the speed of sound (330 m/s); above the speed of sound, we would need a different model of drag and lift.</p><p>Let‚Äôs check our model by seeing what it predicts is the optimum speed for a 747 and for an albatross. We must take care to use the correct air-density: if we want to estimate the optimum cruising speed for a 747 at 30 000 feet, we must remember that air density drops with increasing altitude <em>z</em> as exp(‚àí<em>mgz</em>/<em>kT</em>), where <em>m</em> is the mass of nitrogen or oxygen molecules, and <em>kT</em> is the thermal energy (Boltzmann‚Äôs constant times absolute temperature). The density is about 3 times smaller at that altitude.</p><p>The predicted optimal speeds (table C.6) are more accurate than we have a right to expect<!-- -->!<!-- --> The 747‚Äôs optimal speed is predicted to be 540mph, and the albatross‚Äôs, 32mph ‚Äì both very close to the true cruising speeds of the two birds (560mph and 30‚Äì55mph respectively).</p><p>Let‚Äôs explore a few more predictions of our cartoon. We can check whether the force (C.13) is compatible with the known thrust of the 747.

\end{matrix}]</p><p>So the transport cost is just a dimensionless quantity (related to a plane‚Äôs shape and its engine‚Äôs efficiency), multiplied by <em>g</em>, the acceleration due to gravity. Notice that this gross transport cost applies to all planes, but depends only on three simple properties of the plane: its drag coefficient, the shape of the plane, and its engine efficiency. It doesn‚Äôt depend on the size of the plane, nor on its weight, nor on the density of air. If we plug in <em>Œµ</em> = 1/3 and assume a lift-to-drag ratio of 20 we find the gross transport cost of <em>any</em> plane, according to our cartoon, is</p><p>0.15 <em>g</em></p><p>or</p><p>0.4 kWh/ton-km.</p><h3 id="can-planes-be-improved">Can planes be improved?</h3><p>If engine efficiency can be boosted only a tiny bit by technological progress, and if the shape of the plane has already been essentially perfected, then there is little that can be done about the dimensionless quantity. The transport efficiency is close to its physical limit. The aerodynamics community say that the shape of planes could be improved a little by a switch to blended-wing bodies, and that the drag coefficient could be reduced a little by laminar flow control, a technology that reduces the growth of turbulence over a wing by sucking a little air through small perforations in the surface (Braslow, 1999). Adding laminar flow control to existing planes would deliver a 15% improvement in drag coefficient, and the change of shape to blended-wing bodies is predicted to improve the drag coefficient by about 18% (Green, 2006). And equation (C.26) says that the transport cost is proportional to the square root of the drag coefficient, so improvements of <em>c</em><span class="smallfont1"><sub>d</sub></span> by 15% or 18% would improve transport cost by 7.5% and 9% respectively.</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure278.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure C.10.</span> &quot;Fasten your cufflinks.&quot; A Bombardier Learjet 60XR carrying 8 passengers at 780 km/h has a transport cost of <span class="mauve">150 kWh per 100 passenger-km</span>.

Photograph ¬© Tom Collins.<p>We‚Äôve covered quite a lot of ground<!-- -->!<!-- --> Let‚Äôs recap the key ideas. Half of the work done by a plane goes into <em>staying up</em>; the other half goes into <em>keeping going</em>. The fuel efficiency at the optimal speed, expressed as an energy-per-distance-travelled, was found in the force (C.22), and it was simply proportional to the weight of the plane; the constant of proportionality is the drag-to-lift ratio, which is determined by the shape of the plane. So whereas lowering speed-limits for cars would reduce the energy consumed per distance travelled, there is no point in considering speed-limits for planes. Planes that are up in the air have optimal speeds, different for each plane, depending on its weight, and they already go at their optimal speeds. If you ordered a plane to go slower, its energy consumption would <em>increase</em>. The only way to make a plane consume fuel more efficiently is to put it on the ground and stop it. Planes have been fantastically optimized, and there is no prospect of significant improvements in plane efficiency.

You might think that bigger planes have a bigger range, but the prediction of our model is startlingly simple. The range of the plane, the maximum distance it can go before refuelling, is proportional to its velocity and to the total energy of the fuel, and inversely proportional to the rate at which it guzzles fuel:</p><p>[\begin{matrix}
{\text{range} = v_{\text{opt}} \times \frac{\text{energy}}{\text{power}} = \frac{\text{energy} \times \varepsilon}{\text{force}}\text{.}} <!-- -->\<!-- -->
\end{matrix}]</p><p>Now, the total energy of fuel is the calorific value of the fuel, <em>C</em> (in joules per kilogram), times its mass; and the mass of fuel is some fraction <em>f</em><span class="smallfont1"><sub>fuel</sub></span> of the total mass of the plane. So</p><p>[\begin{matrix}

\end{matrix}]</p><p>It‚Äôs hard to imagine a simpler prediction: the range of any bird or plane is the product of a dimensionless factor <em>Œµf</em><span class="smallfont1"><sub>fuel</sub></span>/ (<em>c</em><span class="smallfont1"><sub>d</sub></span><em>f</em><span class="smallfont1"><sub>A</sub></span>)<sup>1/2</sup> which takes into account the engine efficiency, the drag coefficient, and the bird‚Äôs geometry, with a fundamental distance,</p><p>[\frac{C}{g}]</p><p>which is a property of the fuel and gravity, and nothing else.

It‚Äôs the same distance whether the fuel is goose fat or jet fuel: both these fuels are essentially hydrocarbons (CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub><em>n</em></sub>.

Another amusing thing to notice is that the calorific value of a fuel <em>C</em>, which I gave in joules per kilogram, is also a squared-velocity (just as the energy-to-mass ratio <em>E</em>/<em>m</em> in Einstein‚Äôs <em>E</em> = <em>mc</em><sup>2</sup> is a squared-velocity, <em>c</em><sup>2</sup>): 40 √ó 10<sup>6</sup> J per kg is (6000 m/s)<sup>2</sup>. So one way to think about fat is ‚Äúfat is 6000 metres per second.‚Äù If you want to lose weight by going jogging, 6000 m/s (12 000 mph) is the speed you should aim for in order to lose it all in one giant leap.</p><p>The range of the bird is the intrinsic range of the fuel, 4000 km, times a factor <em>Œµf</em><span class="smallfont1"><sub>fuel</sub></span>/ (<em>c</em><span class="smallfont1"><sub>d</sub></span><em>f</em><span class="smallfont1"><sub>A</sub></span>)<sup>1/2</sup>.

The longest recorded non-stop flight by a bird was a distance of 11 000 km, by a bartailed godwit. <a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 " href="/without-hot-air/chapC/#chCn03"><span class="darkred">[3]</span></a></p><p>How far did Steve Fossett go in the specially-designed Scaled Composites Model 311 Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer? 41 467 km.

Fragile, the plane had several failures along the way.</p><p>One interesting point brought out by this cartoon: if we ask ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the optimum air-density to fly in?‚Äù, we find that the <em>thrust</em> required (C.20) at the optimum speed is independent of the density. So our cartoon plane would be equally happy to fly at any height; there isn‚Äôt an optimum density; the plane could achieve the same miles-per-gallon in any density; but the optimum <em>speed</em> does depend on the density (<em>v</em><sup>2</sup> ~ 1/<em>œÅ</em>, equation (C.16)). So all else being equal, our cartoon plane would have the shortest journey time if it flew in the lowest-density air possible. Now real engines‚Äô efficiencies aren‚Äôt independent of speed and air density. As a plane gets lighter by burning fuel, our cartoon says its optimal speed at a given density would reduce (<em>v</em><sup>2</sup> ~ <em>mg</em>/(<em>œÅ</em>(<em>c</em><sub>d</sub><em>A</em><sub>p</sub><em>A</em><sub>s</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>)). So a plane travelling in air of constant density should slow down a little as it gets lighter. But a plane can both keep going at a <em>constant speed</em> and continue flying at its <em>optimal</em> speed if it increases its altitude so as to reduce the air density. Next time you‚Äôre on a long-distance flight, you could check whether the pilot increases the cruising height from, say, 31 000 feet to 39 000 feet by the end of the flight.</p><h3 id="how-would-a-hydrogen-plane-perform">How would a hydrogen plane perform?</h3><p>We‚Äôve already argued that the efficiency of flight, in terms of energy per ton-km, is just a simple dimensionless number times <em>g</em>.

It would be more energy-efficient to fly shorter hops in shorter-range planes. The sweet spot is when the hops are about 5000 km long, so typical long-distance journeys would have one or two refuelling stops (Green, 2006). Multi-stage long-distance flying might be about 15% more fuel-efficient; but of course it would introduce other costs.</p><h3 id="eco-friendly-aeroplanes">Eco-friendly aeroplanes</h3><p>Occasionally you may hear about people making eco-friendly aeroplanes.

So whereas lowering speed-limits for cars would reduce the energy consumed per distance travelled, there is no point in considering speed-limits for planes.
