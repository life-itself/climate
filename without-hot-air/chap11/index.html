For anyone whose consumption stack is over 100 kWh per day, the BBC‚Äôs advice, <em>always unplug the phone charger</em>, could potentially reduce their energy consumption by one hundredth of one percent (if only they would do it).</p><blockquote><p>Every little helps<!-- -->!</p></blockquote><p>I don‚Äôt think so. Obsessively switching off the phone-charger is like bailing the Titanic with a teaspoon. Do switch it off, but please be aware how tiny a gesture it is. Let me put it this way:</p><blockquote><p>All the energy saved in switching off your charger for one day is used up in <em>one second</em> of car-driving.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The energy saved in switching off the charger for <em>one year</em> is equal to the energy in a single hot bath.</p></blockquote><p>Admittedly, some older chargers use more than half a watt ‚Äì if it‚Äôs warm to the touch, it‚Äôs probably using one watt or even three (figure 11.3). A three-watt-guzzling charger uses 0.07 kWh per day. I think that it‚Äôs a good idea to switch off such a charger ‚Äì it <em>will</em> save you three pounds per year. But don‚Äôt kid yourself that you‚Äôve ‚Äúdone your bit‚Äù by so doing. 3W is only a tiny fraction of total energy consumption.</p><p>OK, that‚Äôs enough bailing the Titanic with a teaspoon. Let‚Äôs find out where the electricity is really being used.</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure80.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 11.3</span>. This wasteful cordless phone and its charger use 3 W when left plugged in. That‚Äôs 0.07 kWh/d. If electricity costs 10p per kWh then a 3 W trickle costs ¬£3 per year.<p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure409.gif"/></p><h2 id="gadgets-that-really-suck">Gadgets that really suck</h2><p>Table 11.4 shows the power consumptions, in watts, of a houseful of gadgets. The first column shows the power consumption when the device is actually being used ‚Äì for example, when a sound system is actually playing sound. The second column shows the consumption when the device is switched on, but sitting doing nothing. I was particularly shocked to find that a laser-printer sitting idle consumes 17 W ‚Äì the same as the average consumption of a fridge-freezer<!-- -->!<!-- --> The third column shows the consumption when the gadget is explicitly asked to go to sleep or standby. The fourth shows the consumption when it is completely switched off ‚Äì but still left plugged in to the mains. I‚Äôm showing all these powers in watts ‚Äì to convert back to our standard units, remember that 40 W is 1 kWh/d. A nice rule of thumb, by the way, is that each watt costs about one pound per year (assuming electricity costs 10p per kWh).</p><p>The biggest guzzlers are the computer, its screen, and the television, whose consumption is in the hundreds of watts, when on. Entertainment systems such as stereos and DVD players swarm in the computer‚Äôs wake, many of them consuming 10 W or so. A DVD player may cost just ¬£20 in the shop, but if you leave it switched on all the time, it‚Äôs costing you another ¬£10 per year. Some stereos and computer peripherals consume several watts even when switched off, thanks to their mains-transformers. To be sure that a gadget is truly off, you need to switch it off at the wall.</p><h3 id="powering-the-hidden-tendrils-of-the-information-age">Powering the hidden tendrils of the information age</h3><p>According to Jonathan Koomey (2007), the computer-servers in US datacentres and their associated plumbing (air conditioners, backup power systems, and so forth) consumed <span class="red">0.4 kWh per day per person</span> ‚Äì just over 1% of US electricity consumption.

The ‚Äòwasted‚Äô energy they put out heats my home, so it‚Äôs not wasted.‚Äù</h4><p>This myth is <em>True</em> for a few people, but only during the winter; but <em>False</em> for most.</p><p>If your house is being heated by electricity through ordinary bar fires or blower heaters then, yes, it‚Äôs much the same as heating the house with any electricity-wasting appliances. But if you are in this situation, you should change the way you heat your house. Electricity is high-grade energy, and heat is low-grade energy. <em>It‚Äôs a waste to turn electricity into heat</em>. To be precise, if you make only one unit of heat from a unit of electricity, that‚Äôs a waste. Heaters called air-source heat pumps or ground-source heat pumps can do much better, delivering 3 or 4 units of heat for every unit of electricity consumed. They work like back-to-front refrigerators, pumping heat into your house from the outside air (see Chapter 21).</p><p>For the rest, whose homes are heated by fossil fuels or biofuels, it‚Äôs a good idea to avoid using electrical gadgets as a heat source for your home ‚Äì at least for as long as our increases in electricity-demand are served from fossil fuels. It‚Äôs better to burn the fossil fuel at home. The point is, if you use electricity from an ordinary fossil power station, more than half of the energy from the fossil fuel goes sadly up the cooling tower. Of the energy that gets turned into electricity, about 8% is lost in the transmission system. If you burn the fossil fuel in your home, more of the energy goes directly into making hot air for you.</p><h2 id="notes-and-further-reading">Notes and further reading</h2><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure82.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 11.6</span>.

The Maplin power meter in figure 11.2 is not accurate enough to measure this sort of power. I am grateful to Sven Weier and Richard McMahon of Cambridge University Engineering Department who measured a standard Nokia charger in an accurate calorimeter; they found that, when not connected to the mobile, it wastes 0.472 W. They made additional interesting measurements: the charger, when connected to a fully-charged mobile phone, wastes 0.845 W; and when the charger is doing what it‚Äôs meant to do, charging a partly-charged Nokia mobile, it wastes 4.146 W as heat. Pedants sometimes ask ‚Äúwhat about the <em>reactive power</em> of the charger?‚Äù This is a technical niggle, not really worth our time. For the record, I measured the reactive power (with a crummy meter) and found it to be about 2 VA per charger. Given that the power loss in the national grid is 8% of the delivered power, I reckon that the power loss associated with the reactive power is at most 0.16 W. When actually making a phone-call, the mobile uses 1 W.<a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-backref" href="/without-hot-air/chap11/#fnref-2">‚Ü©</a></li></ol></div></section></article></main><footer class="flex items-center justify-center w-full h-24 border-t"><a class="flex items-center justify-center" href="https://vercel.com?utm_source=create-next-app&amp;utm_medium=default-template&amp;utm_campaign=create-next-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Project of<img src="/life-itself-logo.svg" alt="Life Itself Logo" class="h-12 block"/></a></footer></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"source":{"compiledSource":"var l=Object.defineProperty,c=Object.defineProperties;var d=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors;var r=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols;var n=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty,i=Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable;var p=(t,a,o)=\u003ea in t?l(t,a,{enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0,value:o}):t[a]=o,e=(t,a)=\u003e{for(var o in a||(a={}))n.call(a,o)\u0026\u0026p(t,o,a[o]);if(r)for(var o of r(a))i.call(a,o)\u0026\u0026p(t,o,a[o]);return t},h=(t,a)=\u003ec(t,d(a));var u=(t,a)=\u003e{var o={};for(var s in t)n.call(t,s)\u0026\u0026a.indexOf(s)\u003c0\u0026\u0026(o[s]=t[s]);if(t!=null\u0026\u0026r)for(var s of r(t))a.indexOf(s)\u003c0\u0026\u0026i.call(t,s)\u0026\u0026(o[s]=t[s]);return o};const layoutProps={},MDXLayout=\"wrapper\";function MDXContent(o){var s=o,{components:t}=s,a=u(s,[\"components\"]);return mdx(MDXLayout,h(e(e({},layoutProps),a),{components:t,mdxType:\"MDXLayout\"}),mdx(\"p\",null,mdx(\"img\",e({parentName:\"p\"},{src:\"/img/without-hot-air/figure78.gif\",alt:null}))),mdx(\"span\",{class:\"figurenumber\"},\"Figure 11.1\"),\".
