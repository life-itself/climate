How does it depend on properties of the car? Could we make cars that are 100 times more efficient? Let‚Äôs make a simple cartoon of car-driving, to describe where the energy goes. The energy in a typical fossil-fuel car goes to four main destinations, all of which we will explore:</p><ol><li>speeding up then slowing down using the brakes;</li><li>air resistance;</li><li>rolling resistance;</li><li>heat ‚Äì 75% of the energy is thrown away as heat, because the energy-conversion chain is inefficient.</li></ol><p>The key formula for most of the calculations in this book is:</p><p>[\text{kinetic\ energy} = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2}]</p><p>For example, a car of mass <em>m</em> = 1000 kg moving at 100 km per hour or <em>v</em> = 28 m/s has an energy of</p><p>[\frac{1}{2}mv^{2} \simeq \text{390~000~J} \simeq \text{0.1~kWh.}]</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure253.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure A.2.</span>Our cartoon: a car moves at speed *v* between stops separated by a distance *d*.<p>Initially our cartoon will ignore rolling resistance; we‚Äôll add in this effect later in the chapter.</p><p>Assume the driver accelerates rapidly up to a cruising speed <em>v</em>, and maintains that speed for a distance <em>d</em>, which is the distance between traffic lights, stop signs, or congestion events. At this point, he slams on the brakes and turns all his kinetic energy into heat in the brakes. (This vehicle doesn‚Äôt have fancy regenerative braking.) Once he‚Äôs able to move again, he accelerates back up to his cruising speed, <em>v</em>. This acceleration gives the car kinetic energy; braking throws that kinetic energy away.</p><p>Energy goes not only into the brakes: while the car is moving, it makes air swirl around. A car leaves behind it a tube of swirling air, moving at a speed similar to <em>v</em>. Which of these two forms of energy is the bigger: kinetic energy of the swirling air, or heat in the brakes? Let‚Äôs work it out.</p><p>The car speeds up and slows down once in each duration <em>d/v</em>. The rate at which energy pours into the brakes is:</p><p>[\begin{matrix}

(For a streamlined car, <em>A</em> is usually a little smaller than the frontal area <em>A</em><sub>car</sub>, and the ratio of the tube‚Äôs effective cross-sectional area to the car area is called the drag coefficient <em>c</em><sub>d</sub>. Throughout the following equations, <em>A</em> means the effective area of the car, <em>c</em><sub>d</sub><em>A</em><sub>car</sub>.) The tube has mass <em>m</em><sub>air</sub> = <em>œÅAvt</em> (where <em>œÅ</em> is the density of air) and swirls at speed <em>v</em>, so its kinetic energy is:</p><p>I‚Äôm using this formula:
mass = density √ó volume</p><p>The symbol <em>œÅ</em> (Greek letter ‚Äòrho‚Äô) denotes the density.</p><p>[\frac{\text{1}}{\text{2}}m_{\text{air}}v^{2} = \frac{\text{1}}{\text{2}}\rho Avt\ v^{2}]</p><p>and the rate of generation of kinetic energy in swirling air is:</p><p>[\frac{\frac{\text{1}}{\text{2}}\rho Avt\ v^{2}}{t} = \frac{\text{1}}{\text{2}}\rho Av^{3}]</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure254.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure A.4.</span> To know whether energy consumption is braking-dominated or air-swirling-dominated, we compare the mass of the car with the mass of the tube of air between stop-signs.<p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure255.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure A.5.</span> Power consumed by a car is proportional to its cross-sectional area, during motorway driving, and to its mass, during town driving. Guess which gets better mileage ‚Äì the VW on the left, or the spaceship?<p>So the total rate of energy production by the car is:</p><p>[\begin{matrix}

\end{matrix}]</p><p>Both forms of energy dissipation scale as <em>v</em><sup>3</sup>. So this cartoon predicts that a driver who halves his speed <em>v</em> makes his power consumption 8 times smaller. If he ends up driving the same total distance, his journey will take twice as long, but the total energy consumed by his journey will be four times smaller.</p><p>Which of the two forms of energy dissipation ‚Äì brakes or air-swirling ‚Äì is the bigger? It depends on the ratio of</p><p>[{\left( {m_{c}/d} \right)/\left( {\rho A} \right)}\text{.}]</p><p>If this ratio is much bigger than 1, then more power is going into brakes; if it is smaller, more power is going into swirling air. Rearranging this ratio, it is bigger than 1 if</p><p>[m_{c} &gt; \rho Ad\text{.}]</p><p>Now, <em>Ad</em> is the volume of the tube of air swept out from one stop sign to the next. And <em>œÅAd</em> is the mass of that tube of air. So we have a very simple situation: energy dissipation is dominated by kinetic-energy-being-dumped-into-the-brakes if the mass of the car is <em>bigger</em> than the mass of the tube of air from one stop sign to the next; and energy dissipation is dominated by making-air-swirl if the mass of the car is <em>smaller</em> (figure A.4).</p><p>Let‚Äôs work out the special distance <em>d</em>*<!-- --> between stop signs, below which the dissipation is braking-dominated and above which it is air-swirling dominated (also known as drag-dominated). If the frontal area of the car is:</p><p>[A_{\text{car}} = \text{2\ m\ wide} \times \text{1.5\ m\ high} = \text{3\ m}^{\text{2}}]</p><p>and the drag coefficient is <!-- -->(<!-- -->c<em>{\text{d}} = \frac{1}{3}<!-- -->)<!-- --> and the mass is <!-- -->(<!-- -->m</em>{\text{c}} = 1000\text{~kg}<!-- -->)<!-- --> then the special distance is:</p><p>[d^{*} = \frac{m<em>{\text{c}}}{\rho c</em>{\text{d}}A_{\text{car}}} = \frac{\text{1000\ kg}}{\text{1.3~}{\text{kg}/{\text{m}^{\text{3}} \times \frac{\text{1}}{\text{3}} \times \text{3~}\text{m}^{\text{2}}}}} = \text{750\ m}]</p><p>So ‚Äúcity-driving‚Äù is dominated by kinetic energy and braking if the distance between stops is less than 750 m. Under these conditions, it‚Äôs a good idea, if you want to save energy:</p><ol><li>to reduce the mass of your car;</li><li>to get a car with regenerative brakes (which roughly halve the energy lost in braking ‚Äì see Chapter 20); <a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 " href="/without-hot-air/chapA/#chAn01"><span class="darkred">[1]</span></a> and</li><li>to drive more slowly.</li></ol><p>When the stops are significantly more than 750 m apart, energy dissipation is drag-dominated.

If you drove at half this speed for two hours per day instead, you would travel the same distance and use up <span class="red">20 kWh</span> of energy. This simple theory seems consistent with the mileage figures for cars quoted in Chapter 3. Moreover, the theory gives insight into how the energy consumed by your car could be reduced. The theory has a couple of flaws which we‚Äôll explore in a moment.</p><p>Could we make a new car that consumes 100 times less energy and still goes at 70mph? <strong>No</strong>. Not if the car has the same shape. On the motorway at 70mph, the energy is going mainly into making air swirl. Changing the materials the car is made from makes no difference to that. A miraculous improvement to the fossil-fuel engine could perhaps boost its efficiency from 25% to 50%, bringing the energy consumption of a fossil-fuelled car down to roughly 40 kWh per 100 km.</p><p>Electric vehicles have some wins: while the weight of the energy store, per useful kWh stored, is about 25 times bigger than that of petrol, the weight of an electric engine can be about 8 times smaller. <a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 " href="/without-hot-air/chapA/#chAn03"><span class="darkred">[3]</span></a> And the energy-chain in an electric car is much more efficient: electric motors can be 90% efficient.</p><p>We‚Äôll come back to electric cars in more detail towards the end of this chapter.</p><h3 id="bicycles-and-the-scaling-trick">Bicycles and the scaling trick</h3><p>Here‚Äôs a fun question: what‚Äôs the energy consumption of a bicycle, in kWh per 100 km? Pushing yourself along on a bicycle requires energy for the same reason as a car: you‚Äôre making air swirl around. Now, we could do all the calculations from scratch, replacing car-numbers by bike-numbers. But there‚Äôs a simple trick we can use to get the answer for the bike from the answer for the car. The energy consumed by a car, per distance travelled, is the power-consumption associated with air-swirling,</p><p>[4 \times \frac{\text{1}}{\text{2}}\rho Av^{3}]</p><p>divided by the speed, <em>v</em>; that is,</p><p>[\text{energy\ per\ distance} = 4 \times \frac{\text{1}}{\text{2}}\rho Av^{2}]</p><p>The ‚Äú4‚Äù came from engine inefficiency; <em>œÅ</em> is the density of air; the area <!-- -->(<!-- -->A = c<em>{\text{d}}A</em>{\text{car}}<!-- -->)<!-- --> is the effective frontal area of a car; and <em>v</em> is its speed. Now, we can compare a bicycle with a car by dividing <!-- -->(<!-- -->4 \times \frac{\text{1}}{\text{2}}\rho Av^{2}<!-- -->)<!-- --> for the bicycle by <!-- -->(<!-- -->4 \times \frac{\text{1}}{\text{2}}\rho Av^{2}<!-- -->)<!-- --> for the car. All the fractions and <em>œÅ</em> cancel, if the efficiency of the carbon-powered bicyclist‚Äôs engine is similar to the efficiency of the carbon-powered car engine (which it is). The ratio is:</p><p>[\frac{\text{energy\ per\ distance\ of\ bike}}{\text{energy\ per\ distance\ of\ car}} = \frac{c<em>{\text{d}}^{\text{bike}}A</em>{\text{bike}}v<em>{\text{bike}}^{2}}{c</em>{\text{d}}^{\text{car}}A<em>{\text{car}}v</em>{\text{car}}^{2}}]</p><p>The trick we are using is called ‚Äúscaling.‚Äù If we know how energy consumption scales with speed and area, then we can predict energy consumption of objects with completely different speeds and areas. Specifically, let‚Äôs assume that the area ratio is</p><p>[\frac{A<em>{\text{bike}}}{A</em>{\text{car}}} = \frac{1}{4}]</p><p>(Four cyclists can sit shoulder to shoulder in the width of one car.) Let‚Äôs assume the bike is not very well streamlined:</p><p>[\frac{c<em>{\text{d}}^{\text{bike}}}{c</em>{\text{d}}^{\text{car}}} = \frac{1}{\frac{\text{1}}{\text{3}}}]</p><p>And let‚Äôs assume the speed of the bike is 21 km/h (13 miles per hour), so</p><p>[\frac{v<em>{\text{bike}}}{v</em>{\text{car}}} = \frac{1}{5}]</p><p>Then</p><p>[\begin{matrix}
<!-- -->\<!-- -->
{= \left( {\frac{c<em>{\text{d}}^{\text{bike}}}{c</em>{\text{d}}^{\text{car}}}\frac{A<em>{\text{bike}}}{A</em>{\text{car}}}} \right)\left( \frac{v<em>{\text{bike}}}{v</em>{\text{car}}} \right)^{2}} <!-- -->\<!-- -->
{= \left( \frac{3}{4} \right) \times \left( \frac{1}{5} \right)^{2}} <!-- -->\<!-- -->
{= \frac{3}{100}} <!-- -->\<!-- -->
\end{matrix}]</p><p>So a cyclist at 21 km/h consumes about 3% of the energy per kilometre of a lone car-driver on the motorway ‚Äì about <strong>2.4 kWh per 100 km</strong>.</p><p>If you would like a vehicle whose fuel efficiency is 30 times better than a car‚Äôs, it‚Äôs simple: ride a bike.</p><h3 id="what-about-rolling-resistance">What about rolling resistance?</h3><p>Some things we‚Äôve completely ignored so far are the energy consumed in the tyres and bearings of the car, the energy that goes into the noise of wheels against asphalt, the energy that goes into grinding rubber off the tyres, and the energy that vehicles put into shaking the ground. Collectively, these forms of energy consumption are called <em>rolling resistance</em>. The standard model of rolling resistance asserts that the force of rolling resistance is simply proportional to the weight of the vehicle, independent of the speed. The constant of proportionality is called the coefficient of rolling resistance, <em>C</em><span class="smallfont1"><sub>rr</sub></span>. Table A.8 gives some typical values.</p><table><thead><tr><th>wheel</th><th><em>C</em><sub>rr</sub></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>train (steel on steel)</td><td>0.002</td></tr><tr><td>bicycle tyre</td><td>0.005</td></tr><tr><td>truck rubber tyres</td><td>0.007</td></tr><tr><td>car rubber tyres</td><td>0.010</td></tr></tbody></table><span class="figurenumber">Table A.8.</span> The rolling resistance is equal to the weight multiplied by the coefficient of rolling resistance, *C*<sub>rr</sub>. The rolling resistance includes the force due to wheel flex, friction losses in the wheel bearings, shaking and vibration of both the roadbed and the vehicle (including energy absorbed by the vehicle‚Äôs shock absorbers), and sliding of the wheels on the road or rail. The coefficient varies with the quality of the road, with the material the wheel is made from, and with temperature. The numbers given here assume smooth roads. [[<span class="websitetitle">2bhu35</span>](http://tinyurl.com/2bhu35)]<h5 id="cars"><em>Cars</em></h5><p>The coefficient of rolling resistance for a car is about 0.01. The effect of rolling resistance is just like perpetually driving up a hill with a slope of one in a hundred. So rolling friction is about 100 newtons per ton, independent of speed. You can confirm this by pushing a typical one-ton car along a flat road. Once you‚Äôve got it moving, you‚Äôll find you can keep it moving with one hand. (100 newtons is the weight of 100 apples.)

They have a point: most cars‚Äô engines have an optimum revolution rate, and the choice of gears of the car determines a range of speeds at which the optimum engine efficiency can be delivered. If my suggested experiment of halving the car‚Äôs speed takes the car out of this designed range of speeds, the consumption might not fall by as much as four-fold. My tacit assumption that the engine‚Äôs efficiency is the same at all speeds and all loads led to the conclusion that it‚Äôs always good (in terms of miles per gallon) to travel slower; but if the engine‚Äôs efficiency drops off at low speeds, then the most fuel-efficient speed might be at an intermediate speed that makes a compromise between going slow and keeping the engine efficient. For the BMW 318ti in figure A.12, for example, the optimum speed is about 60 km/h. But if society were to decide that car speeds should be reduced, there is nothing to stop engines and gears being redesigned so that the peak engine efficiency was found at the right speed. As further evidence that the power a car requires really does increase as the cube of speed, figure A.13 shows the engine power versus the top speeds of a range of cars. The line shows the relationship ‚Äúpower proportional to <em>v</em><sup>3</sup>.‚Äù</p><h3 id="electric-cars-is-range-a-problem">Electric cars: is range a problem?</h3><p>People often say that the range of electric cars is not big enough. Electric car advocates say ‚Äúno problem, we can just put in more batteries‚Äù ‚Äì and that‚Äôs true, but we need to work out what effect the extra batteries have on the energy consumption. The answer depends sensitively on what energy density we assume the batteries deliver: for an energy density of 40 Wh/kg (typical of lead-acid batteries), we‚Äôll see that it‚Äôs hard to push the range beyond 200 or 300 km; but for an energy density of 120 Wh/kg (typical of various lithium-based batteries), a range of 500 km is easily achievable.</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure258.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure A.14.</span> Theory of electric car range (horizontal axis) and transport cost (vertical axis) as a function of battery mass, for two battery technologies. A car with 500 kg of old batteries, with an energy density of 40 Wh per kg, has a range of 180 km. With the same weight of modern batteries, delivering 120 Wh per kg, an electric car can have a range of more than 500 km. Both cars would have an energy cost of about 13 kWh per 100 km. These numbers allow for a battery charging efficiency of 85%.<p>Let‚Äôs assume that the mass of the car and occupants is 740 kg, <em>without</em> any batteries. In due course we‚Äôll add 100 kg, 200 kg, 500 kg, or perhaps 1000 kg of batteries. Let‚Äôs assume a typical speed of 50 km/h (30 mph); a drag-area of 0.8 m<sup>2</sup>; a rolling resistance of 0.01; a distance between stops of 500 m; an engine efficiency of 85%; and that during stops and starts, regenerative braking recovers half of the kinetic energy of the car. Charging up the car from the mains is assumed to be 85% efficient. Figure A.14 shows the transport cost of the car versus its range, as we vary the amount of battery on board. The upper curve shows the result for a battery whose energy density is 40 Wh/kg (old-style lead-acid batteries). The range is limited by a wall at about 500 km. To get close to this maximum range, we have to take along comically large batteries: for a range of 400 km, for example, 2000 kg of batteries are required, and the transport cost is above 25 kWh per 100 km. If we are content with a range of 180 km, however, we can get by with 500 kg of batteries. Things get much better when we switch to lighter lithium-ion batteries. At an energy density of 120 Wh/kg, electric cars with 500 kg of batteries can easily deliver a range of 500 km. The transport cost is predicted to be about 13 kWh per 100 km.</p><p>It thus seems to me that the range problem has been solved by the advent of modern <span id="batteries">batteries</span>. It would be nice to have even better batteries, but an energy density of 120 Wh per kg is already good enough, as long as we‚Äôre happy for the batteries in a car to weigh up to 500 kg. In practice I imagine most people would be content to have a range of 300 km, which can be delivered by 250 kg of batteries. If these batteries were divided into ten 25 kg chunks, separately unpluggable, then a car user could keep just four of the ten chunks on board when he‚Äôs doing regular commuting (100 kg gives a range of 140 km); and collect an extra six chunks from a battery-recharging station when he wants to make longer-range trips. During long-range trips, he would exchange his batteries for a fresh set at a battery-exchange station every 300 km or so.</p><h2 id="notes-and-further-reading">Notes and further reading</h2><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure259.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure A.15.</span> The Wartsila-Sulzer RTA96-C 14-cylinder two-stroke diesel engine. 27 m long and 13.5 m high.
