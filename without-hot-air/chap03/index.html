When I estimate the energy consumed by a particular activity, I tend to choose a fairly tight ‚Äúboundary‚Äù around the activity. This choice makes the estimation easier, but I agree that it‚Äôs a good idea to try to estimate the full energy impact of an activity.

Some people don‚Äôt drive much. In this chapter, I want to estimate the energy consumed by someone who chooses to drive, rather than depersonalize the answer by reporting the UK average, which mixes together the drivers and non-drivers. If I said ‚Äúthe average use of energy for car driving in the UK is 24 kWh/d per person,‚Äù I bet some people would misunderstand and say: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a car driver so I guess I use 24 kWh/d.‚Äù<a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-backref" href="/without-hot-air/chap03/#fnref-1">‚Ü©</a></li><li id="fn-2"><em>‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs use 33 miles per UK gallon.</em> In the European language, this is 8.6 litres per 100 km. 33 miles per gallon was the average for UK cars in 2005 [<a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="http://tinyurl.com/27jdc5"><span class="websitetitle">27jdc5</span></a>].

When looking up calorific values, you‚Äôll find ‚Äúgross calorific value‚Äù and ‚Äúnet calorific value‚Äù listed (also known as ‚Äúhigh heat value‚Äù and ‚Äúlow heat value‚Äù). These differ by only 6% for motor fuels, so it‚Äôs not crucial to distinguish them here, but let me explain anyway. The gross calorific value is the actual chemical energy released when the fuel is burned. One of the products of combustion is water, and in most engines and power stations, part of the energy goes into vaporizing this water. The net calorific value measures how much energy is left over assuming this energy of vaporization is discarded and wasted. When we ask ‚Äúhow much energy does my lifestyle consume?‚Äù the gross calorific value is the right quantity to use. The net calorific value, on the other hand, is of interest to a power station engineer, who needs to decide which fuel to burn in his power station. Throughout this book I‚Äôve tried to use gross calorific values. A final note for party-pooping pedants who say ‚Äúbutter is not a hydrocarbon‚Äù: OK, butter is not a pure hydrocarbon; but it‚Äôs a good approximation to say that the main component of butter is long hydrocarbon chains, just like petrol. The proof of the pudding is, this approximation got us within 30% of the correct answer.

These differ by only 6% for motor fuels, so it\\u2019s not crucial to distinguish them here, but let me explain anyway. The gross calorific value is the actual chemical energy released when the fuel is burned. One of the products of combustion is water, and in most engines and power stations, part of the energy goes into vaporizing this water. The net calorific value measures how much energy is left over assuming this energy of vaporization is discarded and wasted. When we ask \\u201Chow much energy does my lifestyle consume?\\u201D the gross calorific value is the right quantity to use. The net calorific value, on the other hand, is of interest to a power station engineer, who needs to decide which fuel to burn in his power station. Throughout this book I\\u2019ve tried to use gross calorific values.
