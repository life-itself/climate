In the last three chapters we found car-driving and plane-flying to be bigger than the plausible on-shore wind-power potential of the United Kingdom. Could solar power put production back in the lead?</p><p>The power of raw sunshine at midday on a cloudless day is 1000W per square metre. That‚Äôs 1000 W per m<sup>2</sup> of area oriented towards the sun, not per m<sup>2</sup> of land area. To get the power per m<sup>2</sup> of <em>land area</em> in Britain, we must make several corrections. We need to compensate for the tilt between the sun and the land, <sup id="fnref-1"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap06/#fn-1">1</a></sup> which reduces the intensity of midday sun to about 60% of its value at the equator (figure 6.1). We also lose out because it is not midday all the time. On a cloud-free day in March or September, the ratio of the <em>average</em> intensity to the midday intensity is about 32%. Finally, we lose power because of cloud cover. In a typical UK location the sun shines during just 34% of daylight hours. <sup id="fnref-2"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap06/#fn-2">2</a></sup></p><p>The combined effect of these three factors and the additional complication of the wobble of the seasons is that the average raw power of sunshine per square metre of south-facing roof in Britain is roughly 110 W/m<sup>2</sup>, and the average raw power of sunshine per square metre of flat ground is roughly 100 W/m<sup>2</sup>. <sup id="fnref-3"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap06/#fn-3">3</a></sup></p><p>We can turn this raw power into useful power in four ways:</p><ol><li>Solar thermal: using the sunshine for direct heating of buildings or water.</li><li>Solar photovoltaic: generating electricity.</li><li>Solar biomass: using trees, bacteria, algae, corn, soy beans, or oilseed to make energy fuels, chemicals, or building materials.</li><li>Food: the same as solar biomass, except we shovel the plants into humans or other animals.</li></ol><p>(In a later chapter we‚Äôll also visit a couple of other solar power techniques appropriate for use in deserts.)</p><p>Let‚Äôs make quick rough estimates of the maximum plausible powers that each of these routes could deliver.

The experiment simulated the hot-water consumption of an average European household ‚Äì 100 litres of hot (60¬∞C) water per day. The 1.5‚Äì2 kWh/d gap between the total heat generated (black line, top) and the hot water used (red line) is caused by heat-loss. The magenta line shows the electrical power required to run the solar system.

Heat can‚Äôt be exported to the electricity grid. If you don‚Äôt need it, then it‚Äôs wasted. We should bear in mind that much of this captured heat would not be in the right place. In cities, where many people live, residential accommodation has less roof area per person than the national average. Furthermore, this power would be delivered non-uniformly through the year.</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure36.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 6.4.</span> Solar thermal: a 10 m<sup>2</sup> array of thermal panels can deliver (on average) about 13 kWh per day of thermal energy.<h2 id="solar-photovoltaic">Solar photovoltaic</h2><p>Photovoltaic (PV) panels convert sunlight into electricity. <sup id="fnref-5"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap06/#fn-5">5</a></sup> Typical solar panels have an efficiency of about 10%; expensive ones perform at 20%. <sup id="fnref-6"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap06/#fn-6">6</a></sup> (Fundamental physical laws limit the efficiency of photovoltaic systems to at best 60% with perfect concentrating mirrors or lenses, and 45% without concentration.

The peak power delivered by this array is about 4 kW. The average, year-round, is 12 kWh per day. That‚Äôs 20 W per square metre of panel. [^8]<p>Since the area of all south-facing roofs is 10 m<sup>2</sup> per person, there certainly isn‚Äôt space on our roofs for these photovoltaic panels as well as the solar thermal panels of the last section. So we have to choose whether to have the photovoltaic contribution or the solar hot water contribution. But I‚Äôll just plop both these on the production stack anyway. Incidentally, the present cost of installing such photovoltaic panels is about four times the cost of installing solar thermal panels, but they deliver only half as much energy, albeit high-grade energy (electricity). So I‚Äôd advise a family thinking of going solar to investigate the solar thermal option first. The smartest solution, at least in sunny countries, is to make combined systems that deliver both electricity and hot water from a single installation. This is the approach pioneered by Heliodynamics, <sup id="fnref-9"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap06/#fn-9">9</a></sup> who reduce the overall cost of their systems by surrounding small high-grade gallium arsenide photovoltaic units with arrays of slowly-moving flat mirrors; the mirrors focus the sunlight onto the photovoltaic units, which deliver both electricity and hot water; the hot water is generated by pumping water past the back of the photovoltaic units.</p><p>The conclusion so far: covering your south-facing roof at home with photovoltaics may provide enough juice to cover quite a big chunk of your personal average electricity consumption; but roofs are not big enough to make a huge dent in our total <em>energy</em> consumption. To do more with PV, we need to step down to terra firma. The solar warriors in figure 6.6 show the way.</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure37.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 6.6</span>.

Well, if we covered 5% of the UK with 10%-efficient panels, we‚Äôd have</p><p>10% √ó 100 W/m<sup>2</sup> √ó 200 m<sup>2</sup> per person ‚âà <span class="green">50 kWh/day/person</span>.</p><p>I assumed only 10%-efficient panels, by the way, because I imagine that solar panels would be mass-produced on such a scale only if they were very cheap, and it‚Äôs the lower-efficiency panels that will get cheap first.

Yes, no problem: windmills cast little shadow, and ground-level solar panels have negligible effect on the wind. How audacious is this plan? The solar power capacity required to deliver this 50 kWh per day per person in the UK is more than 100 times all the photovoltaics in the whole world. <sup id="fnref-11"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap06/#fn-11">11</a></sup> So should I include the PV farm in my sustainable production stack? I‚Äôm in two minds. At the start of this book I said I wanted to explore what the laws of physics say about the limits of sustainable energy, assuming money is no object. On those grounds, I should certainly go ahead, industrialize the countryside, and push the PV farm onto the stack. At the same time, I want to help people figure out what we should be doing between <em>now</em> and 2050. And today, electricity from solar farms would be four times as expensive as the market rate. So I feel a bit irresponsible as I include this estimate in the sustainable production stack in figure 6.9 ‚Äì paving 5% of the UK with solar panels seems beyond the bounds of plausibility in so many ways. <sup id="fnref-12"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap06/#fn-12">12</a></sup> If we seriously contemplated doing such a thing, it would quite probably be better to put the panels in a two-fold sunnier country and send some of the energy home by power lines. We‚Äôll return to this idea in Chapter 25.</p><h3 id="mythconceptions">Mythconceptions</h3><h4 id="manufacturing-a-solar-panel-consumes-more-energy-than-it-will-ever-deliver">Manufacturing a solar panel consumes more energy than it will ever deliver.</h4><p><em>False</em>.

But this chapter‚Äôs photovoltaic estimates weren‚Äôt constrained by the economic cost of the panels, nor by the energy cost of their manufacture. This chapter was concerned with the maximum conceivable power delivered. Photovoltaic panels with 20% efficiency are already close to the theoretical limit (see this chapter‚Äôs endnotes). I‚Äôll be surprised if this chapter‚Äôs estimate for roof-based photovoltaics ever needs a significant upward revision.</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure41.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 6.9.</span> Solar photovoltaics: a 10 m<sup>2</sup> array of building-mounted south-facing panels with 20% efficiency can deliver about 5 kWh per day of electrical energy.

That‚Äôs what‚Äôs close to happening.</em></p><p>George W. Bush, February 2006</p></blockquote><p>All available bioenergy solutions involve first growing green stuff, and then doing something with the green stuff. How big could the energy collected by the green stuff possibly be? There are four main routes to get energy from solar-powered biological systems:</p><ol><li>We can grow specially-chosen plants and burn them in a power station that produces electricity or heat or both. We‚Äôll call this ‚Äúcoal substitution.‚Äù</li><li>We can grow specially-chosen plants (oil-seed rape, sugar cane, or corn, say), turn them into ethanol or biodiesel, and shove that into cars, trains, planes or other places where such chemicals are useful. Or we might cultivate genetically-engineered bacteria, cyanobacteria, or algae that directly produce hydrogen, ethanol, or butanol, or even electricity. We‚Äôll call all such approaches ‚Äúpetroleum substitution.‚Äù</li><li>We can take by-products from other agricultural activities and burn them in a power station. The by-products might range from straw (a by-product of Weetabix) to chicken poo (a by-product of McNuggets). Burning by-products is coal substitution again, but using ordinary plants, not the best high-energy plants. A power station that burns agricultural by-products won‚Äôt deliver as much power per unit area of farmland as an optimized biomass-growing facility, but it has the <span id="page43">advantage</span> that it doesn‚Äôt monopolize the land. Burning methane gas from landfill sites is a similar way of getting energy, but it‚Äôs sustainable only as long as we have a sustainable source of junk to keep putting into the landfill sites. (Most of the landfill methane comes from wasted food; people in Britain throw away about 300 g of food per day per person.) <sup id="fnref-13"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap06/#fn-13">13</a></sup> Incinerating household waste is another slightly less roundabout way of getting power from solar biomass.</li><li>We can grow plants and feed them directly to energy-requiring humans or other animals.</li></ol><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure43.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 6.10.</span> Some *Miscanthus* grass enjoying the company of Dr Emily Heaton, who is 5‚Ä≤4‚Ä≥ (163 cm) tall.

[^14]<p>For all of these processes, the first staging post for the energy is in a chemical molecule such as a carbohydrate in a green plant. We can therefore estimate the power obtainable from any and all of these processes by estimating how much power could pass through that first staging post. All subsequent steps involving tractors, animals, chemical facilities, landfill sites, or power stations can only lose energy. So the power at the first staging post is an upper bound on the power available from all plant-based power solutions.</p><p>So, let‚Äôs simply estimate the power at the first staging post. (In Chapter D we‚Äôll go into more detail, estimating the maximum contribution of each process.) The average harvestable power of sunlight in Britain is 100 W/m<sup>2</sup>. The most efficient plants in Europe are about 2%-efficient at turning solar energy into carbohydrates, which would suggest that plants might deliver 2 W/m<sup>2</sup>; however, their efficiency drops at higher light levels, and the best performance of any energy crops in Europe is closer to <span class="green">0.5 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>. <sup id="fnref-15"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap06/#fn-15">15</a></sup> Let‚Äôs cover 75% of the country with quality green stuff.

That‚Äôs not very much, considering the outrageously generous assumptions we just made, to try to get a big number.

Archer and Barber suggest that by genetic modification, it might be possible to improve the storage efficiency of plants, especially <em>C4 plants</em>, which have already naturally evolved a more efficient photosynthetic pathway. C4 plants are mainly found in the tropics and thrive in high temperatures; they don‚Äôt grow at temperatures below 10¬∞C. Some examples of C4 plants are sugarcane, maize, sorghum, finger millet, and switchgrass. Zhu et al. (2008) calculate that the theoretical limit for the conversion efficiency of solar energy to biomass is 4.6% for C3 photosynthesis at 30¬∞C and today‚Äôs 380 ppm atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, and 6% for C4 photosynthesis. They say that the highest solar energy conversion efficiencies reported for C3 and C4 crops are 2.4% and 3.7% respectively; and, citing Boyer (1982), that the average conversion efficiencies of major crops in the US are 3 or 4 times lower than those record efficiencies (that is, about 1% efficient). One reason that plants don‚Äôt achieve the theoretical limit is that they have insufficient capacity to use all the incoming radiation of bright sunlight. Both these papers (Zhu et al., 2008; Boyer, 1982) discuss prospects for genetic engineering of more-efficient plants.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr/><ol><li id="fn-1"><em>‚Ä¶ compensate for the tilt between the sun and the land.</em> The latitude of Cambridge is Œ∏ = 52¬∞; the intensity of midday sunlight is multiplied by cos Œ∏ ‚âà 0.6.

As figure 6.15 shows, the power delivered by photovoltaic panels is almost exactly proportional to the intensity of the sunlight ‚Äì at least, if the panels are at 25¬∞C.

This is a quote from Hopfield and Gollub (1978), who were writing about panels without concentrating mirrors or lenses. The theoretical limit for a standard ‚Äúsingle-junction‚Äù solar panel without concentrators, the Shockley‚ÄìQueisser limit, says that at most 31% of the energy in sunlight can be converted to electricity (Shockley and Queisser, 1961). (The main reason for this limit is that a standard solar material has a property called its band-gap, which defines a particular energy of photon that that material converts most efficiently. Sunlight contains photons with many energies; photons with energy <em>below</em> the band-gap are not used at all; photons with energy <em>greater</em> than the band-gap may be captured, but all their energy in excess of the band-gap is lost.) Concentrators (lenses or mirrors) can both reduce the cost (per watt) of photovoltaic systems, and increase their efficiency. The Shockley‚ÄìQueisser limit for solar panels with concentrators is 41% efficiency. The only way to beat the Shockley‚ÄìQueisser limit is to make fancy photovoltaic devices that split the light into different wavelengths, processing each wavelength-range with its own personalized band-gap. These are called multiple-junction photovoltaics. Recently multiple-junction photovoltaics with optical concentrators have been reported to be about 40% efficient.

This is a quote from Hopfield and Gollub (1978), who were writing about panels without concentrating mirrors or lenses. The theoretical limit for a standard \\u201Csingle-junction\\u201D solar panel without concentrators, the Shockley\\u2013Queisser limit, says that at most 31% of the energy in sunlight can be converted to electricity (Shockley and Queisser, 1961). (The main reason for this limit is that a standard solar material has a property called its band-gap, which defines a particular energy of photon that that material converts most efficiently. Sunlight contains photons with many energies; photons with energy \",mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"li\"},\"below\"),\" the band-gap are not used at all; photons with energy \",mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"li\"},\"greater\"),\" than the band-gap may be captured, but all their energy in excess of the band-gap is lost.) Concentrators (lenses or mirrors) can both reduce the cost (per watt) of photovoltaic systems, and increase their efficiency. The Shockley\\u2013Queisser limit for solar panels with concentrators is 41% efficiency. The only way to beat the Shockley\\u2013Queisser limit is to make fancy photovoltaic devices that split the light into different wavelengths, processing each wavelength-range with its own personalized band-gap. These are called multiple-junction photovoltaics. Recently multiple-junction photovoltaics with optical concentrators have been reported to be about 40% efficient.
