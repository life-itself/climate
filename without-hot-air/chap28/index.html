class="figurenumber">Figure 28.1.</span> Plan M<p>Let me try to make clear the scale of the previous chapter‚Äôs plans by showing you a map of Britain bearing a sixth plan. This sixth plan lies roughly in the middle of the first five, so I call it plan M (figure 28.1).</p><p>The areas and rough costs of these facilities are shown in table 28.3. For simplicity, the financial costs are estimated using today‚Äôs prices for comparable facilities, many of which are early prototypes. We can expect many of the prices to drop significantly. The rough costs given here are the building costs, and don‚Äôt include running costs or decommissioning costs. The ‚Äúper person‚Äù costs are found by dividing the total cost by 60 million. Please remember, this is not a book about economics ‚Äì that would require another 400 pages<!-- -->!<!-- --> I‚Äôm providing these cost estimates only to give a rough indication of the price tag we should expect to see on a plan that adds up.</p><p>I‚Äôd like to emphasize that I am not advocating this particular plan ‚Äì it includes several features that I, as dictator of Britain, would not select. I‚Äôve deliberately included all available technologies, so that you can try out your own plans with other mixes.</p><p>For example, if you say ‚Äúphotovoltaics are going to be too expensive, I‚Äôd like a plan with more wave power instead,‚Äù you can see how to do it: you need to increase the wave farms eight-fold. If you don‚Äôt like the wind farms‚Äô locations, feel free to move them (but where to?). Bear in mind that putting more of them offshore will increase costs. If you‚Äôd like fewer wind farms, no problem ‚Äì just specify which of the other technologies you‚Äôd like instead. You can replace five of the 100 km<sup>2</sup> wind farms by adding one more 1 GW nuclear power station, for example.</p><p>Perhaps you think that this plan (like each of the five plans in the previous chapter) devotes unreasonably large areas to biofuels. Fine: you may therefore conclude that the demand for liquid fuels for transport must be reduced below the 2 kWh per day per person that this plan assumed; or that liquid fuels must be created in some other way.</p><h2 id="cost-of-switching-from-fossil-fuels-to-renewables">Cost of switching from fossil fuels to renewables</h2><p>Every wind farm costs a few million pounds to build and delivers a few megawatts. As a very rough ballpark figure in 2008, installing one watt of capacity costs one pound; one kilowatt costs 1000 pounds; a megawatt of wind costs a million; a gigawatt of nuclear costs a billion or perhaps two. Other renewables are more expensive. We (the UK) currently consume a total power of roughly 300 GW, most of which is fossil fuel. So we can anticipate that a major switching from fossil fuel to renewables and/or nuclear is going to require roughly 300 GW of renewables and/or nuclear and</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure235.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 28.2.</span> A plan that adds up, for Scotland, England, and Wales.

The rough costs in table 28.3 add up to ¬£870 bn, with the solar power facilities dominating the total ‚Äì the photovoltaics cost ¬£190 bn and the concentrating solar stations cost ¬£340 bn. Both these costs might well come down dramatically as we learn by doing. A government report leaked by the Guardian in August 2007 <sup id="fnref-2"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap28/#fn-2">2</a></sup> estimates that achieving ‚Äú20% by 2020‚Äù (that is, 20% of all energy from renewables, which would require an increase in renewable power of 80 GW) could cost ‚Äúup to ¬£22 billion‚Äù (which would average out to ¬£1.7 billion per year). Even though this estimate is smaller than the ¬£80 billion that the rule of thumb I just mentioned would have suggested, the authors of the leaked report seem to view ¬£22 billion as an ‚Äúunreasonable‚Äù cost, preferring a target of just 9% renewables. (Another reason they give for disliking the ‚Äú20% by 2020‚Äù target is that the resulting greenhouse gas savings ‚Äúrisk making the EU emissions trading scheme redundant.‚Äù Terrifying thought<!-- -->!<!-- -->)</p><h2 id="other-things-that-cost-a-billion">Other things that cost a billion</h2><p>Billions are big numbers and hard to get a feel for. To try to help put the cost of kicking fossil fuels into perspective, let‚Äôs now list some other things that also come in billions of pounds, or in billions per year. I‚Äôll also express many of these expenditures ‚Äúper person,‚Äù dividing the total by an appropriate population.</p><p>Perhaps the most relevant quantity to compare with is the money we <em>already</em> spend on energy every year. In the UK, the money spent on energy by final users is ¬£75 billion per year, and the total market value of all energy consumed is ¬£130 billion per year. So the idea of spending ¬£1.7 billion per year on investment in future energy infrastructure seems not at all unreasonable ‚Äì it is less than 3% of our current expenditure on energy<!-- -->!</p><p>Another good comparison to make is with our annual expenditure on insurance: some of the investments we need to make offer an uncertain return ‚Äì just like insurance.
