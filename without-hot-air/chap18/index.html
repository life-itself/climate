The state of play after we added up all the traditional renewables.<h1 id="18-can-we-live-on-renewables">18 Can we live on renewables?</h1><p>The red stack in figure 18.1 adds up to <span class="red">195 kWh per day per person</span>. The green stack adds up to about <span class="green">180 kWh/d/p</span>. A close race<!-- -->!<!-- --> But please remember: in calculating our production stack we threw all economic, social, and environmental constraints to the wind. Also, some of our green contributors are probably incompatible with each other: our photovoltaic panels and hot-water panels would clash with each other on roofs; and our solar photovoltaic farms using 5% of the country might compete with the energy crops with which we covered 75% of the country. If we were to lose just one of our bigger green contributors ‚Äì for example, if we decided that deep offshore wind is not an option, or that panelling 5% of the country with photovoltaics at a cost of ¬£200 000 per person is not on ‚Äì then the production stack would no longer match the consumption stack.</p><p>Furthermore, even if our red consumption stack were lower than our green production stack, it would not necessarily mean our energy sums are adding up. You can‚Äôt power a TV with cat food, nor can you feed a cat from a wind turbine. Energy exists in different forms ‚Äì chemical, electrical, kinetic, and heat, for example. For a sustainable energy plan to add up, we need both the forms and amounts of energy consumption and production to match up. Converting energy from one form to another ‚Äì from chemical to electrical, as at a fossil-fuel power station, or from electrical to chemical, as in a factory making hydrogen from water ‚Äì usually involves substantial losses of useful energy. We will come back to this important detail in Chapter 27, which will describe some energy plans that do add up.</p><p>Here we‚Äôll reflect on our estimates of consumption and production, compare them with official averages and with other people‚Äôs estimates, and discuss how much power renewables could plausibly deliver in a country like Britain.</p><p>The questions we‚Äôll address in this chapter are:</p><ol><li>Is the size of the red stack roughly correct? What is the <em>average</em> consumption of Britain? We‚Äôll look at the official energy-consumption numbers for Britain and a few other countries.</li><li>Have I been unfair to renewables, underestimating their potential? We‚Äôll compare the estimates in the green stack with estimates published by organizations such as the Sustainable Development Commission, the Institution of Electrical Engineers, and the Centre for Alternative Technology.</li><li>What happens to the green stack when we take into account social and economic constraints?</li></ol><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure129.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 18.2</span>. Energy consumption, broken down by end use, according to the Department for Trade and Industry.<h2 id="red-reflections">Red reflections</h2><p>Our estimate of a typical affluent person‚Äôs consumption (figure 18.1) has reached <span class="red">195 kWh per day</span>. It is indeed true that many people use this much energy, and that many more aspire to such levels of consumption. The <em>average</em> American consumes about <span><span class="red">250 kWh per day</span></span>. If we all raised our standard of consumption to an average American level, the green production stack would definitely be dwarfed by the red consumption stack.</p><p>What about the average European and the average Brit? Average European consumption of ‚Äúprimary energy‚Äù (which means the energy contained in raw fuels, plus wind and hydroelectricity) is about <span class="red">125 kWh per day per person</span>. The UK average is also <span class="red">125 kWh per day per person</span>. <sup id="fnref-1"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap18/#fn-1">1</a></sup></p><p>These official averages do not include two energy flows. First, the ‚Äúembedded energy‚Äù in <em>imported</em> stuff (the energy expended in making the stuff) is not included at all. We estimated in Chapter 15 that the embedded energy in imported stuff is at least 40 kWh/d per person. Second, the official estimates of ‚Äúprimary energy consumption‚Äù include only industrial energy flows ‚Äì things like fossil fuels and hydroelectricity ‚Äì and don‚Äôt keep track of the natural embedded energy in food: energy that was originally harnessed by photosynthesis.</p><p>Another difference between the red stack we slapped together and the national total is that in most of the consumption chapters so far we tended to ignore the energy lost in converting energy from one form to another, and in transporting energy around. For example, the ‚Äúcar‚Äù estimate in Part I covered only the energy in the petrol, not the energy used at the oil refinery that makes the petrol, nor the energy used in trundling the oil and petrol from A to B. The national total accounts for all the energy, before any conversion losses. Conversion losses in fact account for about 22% of total national energy consumption. Most of these conversion losses happen at power stations. Losses in the electricity transmission network chuck away 1% of total national energy consumption. <sup id="fnref-2"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap18/#fn-2">2</a></sup></p><p>When building our red stack, we tried to imagine how much energy a typical affluent person uses. Has this approach biased our perception of the importance of different activities? Let‚Äôs look at some official numbers. Figure 18.2 shows the breakdown of energy consumption by end use. The top two categories are transport and heating (hot air and hot water). Those two categories also dominated the red stack in Part I.

[^3]<p>Let‚Äôs look more closely at transport. In our red stack, we found that the energy footprints of driving a car 50 km per day and of flying to Cape Town once per year are roughly equal. Table 18.3 shows the relative importances of the different transport modes in the national balance-sheet. In the national averages, aviation is smaller than road transport.</p><p>How do Britain‚Äôs official consumption figures compare with those of other countries? Figure 18.4 shows the power consumptions of lots of countries or regions, versus their gross domestic products (GDPs). There‚Äôs an evident correlation between power consumption and GDP: the higher a country‚Äôs GDP (per capita), the more power it consumes per capita. The UK is a fairly typical high-GDP country, surrounded by Germany, France, Japan, Austria, Ireland, Switzerland, and Denmark. The only notable exception to the rule ‚Äúbig GDP implies big power consumption‚Äù is Hong Kong. Hong Kong‚Äôs GDP per capita is about the same as Britain‚Äôs, but Hong Kong‚Äôs power consumption is about <span class="red">80 kWh/d/p</span>.</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure127.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 18.5</span>.

Have I been mean to green? Are my numbers a load of rubbish? Have I underestimated sustainable production? Let‚Äôs compare my green numbers first with several estimates found in the Sustainable Development Commission‚Äôs publication <em>The role of nuclear power in a low carbon economy. Reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions ‚Äì nuclear and the alternatives</em>. Remarkably, even though the Sustainable Development Commission‚Äôs take on sustainable resources is very positive (‚ÄúWe have huge tidal, wave, biomass and solar resources‚Äù), <em>all the estimates in the Sustainable Development Commission‚Äôs document are smaller than mine<!-- -->!</em> (To be precise, all the estimates of the renewables total are smaller than my total.) The Sustainable Development Commission‚Äôs publication gives estimates from four sources detailed below (IEE, Tyndall, IAG, and PIU). Figure 18.6 shows my estimates alongside numbers from these four sources and numbers from the Centre for Alternative Technology (CAT). Here‚Äôs a description of each source.</p><ul><li><strong>IEE</strong>
The Institute of Electrical Engineers published a report on renewable energy in 2002 ‚Äì a summary of possible contributions from renewables in the UK. The second column of figure 18.6 shows the ‚Äútechnical potential‚Äù of a variety of renewable technologies for UK electricity generation ‚Äì ‚Äúan upper limit that is unlikely ever to be exceeded even with quite dramatic changes in the structure of our society and economy.‚Äù According to the IEE, the total of all renewables‚Äô technical potential is about 27 kWh/d per person.</li><li><strong>Tyndall</strong>
The Tyndall Centre‚Äôs estimate of the total practicable renewable energy resource is 15 kWh per day per person.</li><li><strong>IAG</strong>
The Interdepartmental Analysts Group‚Äôs estimates of renewables, take into account economic constraints. Their total practical <em>and</em> economical resource (at a retail price of 7p/kWh) is 12 kWh per day per person.</li><li><strong>PIU</strong>
The ‚ÄúPIU‚Äù column shows the ‚Äúindicative resource potential for renewable electricity generation options‚Äù from the DTI‚Äôs contribution to the PIU review in 2001. For each technology I show their ‚Äúpractical maximum,‚Äù or, if no practical maximum was given, their ‚Äútheoretical maximum.‚Äù</li><li><strong>CAT</strong>

It‚Äôs been estimated that the average person‚Äôs lifestyle consumed a power of 20 kWh per day. <sup id="fnref-4"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap18/#fn-4">4</a></sup> The wood used per person was 4 kg per day, which required 1 hectare (10 000 m<sup>2</sup>) of forest per person. The area of land per person in Europe in the 1700s was 52 000 m<sup>2</sup>. In the regions with highest population density, the area per person was 17 500 m<sup>2</sup> of arable land, pastures, and woods. Today the area of Britain per person is just 4000 m<sup>2</sup>, so even if we reverted to the lifestyle of the Middle Ages and completely forested the country, we could no longer live sustainably here. Our population density is far too high.</p><h2 id="green-ambitions-meet-social-reality">Green ambitions meet social reality</h2><p>Figure 18.7 is bleak news. Yes, technically, Britain has ‚Äúhuge‚Äù renewables. But realistically, I don‚Äôt think Britain can live on its own renewables ‚Äì at least not the way we currently live. I am partly driven to this conclusion by the chorus of opposition that greets any major renewable energy proposal. People love renewable energy, <em>unless it is bigger than a figleaf</em>.

The assumption was that we want to get off fossil fuels, for one or more of the reasons listed in Chapter 1 ‚Äì climate change, security of supply, and so forth. Figure 18.9 shows how much power we currently get from renewables and nuclear. They amount to just 4% of our total power consumption.</p><p>The two conclusions we can draw from Part I are:</p><ol><li><p><em>To make a difference, renewable facilities have to be country-sized</em>.</p><p>For any renewable facility to make a contribution comparable to our current consumption, <em>it has to be country-sized</em>. To get a big contribution from wind, we used wind farms with the area of Wales. To get a big contribution from solar photovoltaics, we required half the area of Wales. To get a big contribution from waves, we imagined wave farms covering 500 km of coastline. To make energy crops with a big contribution, we took 75% of the whole country.</p><p>Renewable facilities have to be country-sized because all renewables are so diffuse. Table 18.10 summarizes most of the powers-per-unit-area that we encountered in Part I.</p><p>To sustain Britain‚Äôs lifestyle on its renewables alone would be very difficult.

I took this number from the UNDP Human Development Report, 2007. The DTI (now known as DBERR) publishes a Digest of United Kingdom Energy Statistics every year. [<a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="http://tinyurl.com/uzek2"><span class="websitetitle">uzek2</span></a>]. In 2006, according to DUKES, total primary energy demand was 244 million tons of oil equivalent, which corresponds to 130 kWh per day per person. I don‚Äôt know the reason for the small difference between the UNDP number and the DUKES number, but I can explain why I chose the slightly lower number. As I mentioned in <a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="../Text/chap02.xhtml#DUKES">chapter 2</a>, DUKES uses the same energy-summing convention as me, declaring one kWh of chemical energy to be equal to one kWh of electricity.

But there\\u2019s one minor exception: DUKES defines the \\u201Cprimary energy\\u201D produced in nuclear power stations to be the thermal energy, which in 2006 was 9 kWh/d/p; this was converted (with 38% efficiency) to 3.4 kWh/d/p of supplied electricity; in my accounts, I\\u2019ve focused on the electricity produced by hydroelectricity, other renewables, and nuclear power; this small switch in convention reduces the nuclear contribution by about 5 kWh/d/p.\",mdx(\"a\",e({parentName:\"li\"},{href:\"#fnref-1\",className:\"footnote-backref\"}),\"\\u21A9\")),mdx(\"li\",e({parentName:\"ol\"},{id:\"fn-2\"}),mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"li\"},\"Losses in the electricity transmission network chuck away 1% of total national energy consumption\"),\". To put it another way, the losses are 8% of the electricity generated. This 8% loss can be broken down: roughly 1.5% is lost in the long-distance high-voltage system, and 6% in the local public supply system. Source: MacLeay et al.
