Renewable facilities have to be country-sized because all renewables are so diffuse.<p>Most of the resources for living sustainably are related to land area: if you want to use solar panels, you need land to put them on; if you want to grow crops, you need land again. Jared Diamond, in his book Collapse, observes that, while many factors contribute to the collapse of civilizations, a common feature of all collapses is that the human population density became too great.</p><p>Places like Britain and Europe are in a pickle because they have large population densities, and all the available renewables are diffuse ‚Äì they have small power density (table 25.1).

Concentrating solar power stations come in several flavours, arranging their moving mirrors in various geometries, and putting various power conversion technologies at the focus ‚Äì Stirling engines, pressurized water, or molten salt, for example ‚Äì but they all deliver fairly similar average powers per unit area, in the ballpark of <span class="green">15 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>.</p><h2 id="a-technology-that-adds-up">A technology that adds up</h2><p>‚ÄúAll the world‚Äôs power could be provided by a square 100 km by 100 km in the Sahara.‚Äù Is this true? Concentrating solar power in deserts delivers an average power per unit land area of roughly <span class="green">15 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>. <sup id="fnref-1"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap25/#fn-1">1</a></sup> So, allowing no space for anything else in such a square, the power delivered would be 150 GW. This is <em>not</em> the same as current world power consumption. It‚Äôs not even near current world <em>electricity</em> consumption, which is 2000 GW. World power consumption today is 15 000 GW. So the correct statement about power from the Sahara is that today‚Äôs consumption could be provided by a <em>1000 km by 1000 km</em> square in the desert, completely filled with concentrating solar power. That‚Äôs four times the area of the UK. And if we are interested in living in an equitable world, we should presumably aim to supply more than <em>today‚Äôs</em> consumption. To supply every person in the world with an average European‚Äôs power consumption (125 kWh/d), the area required would be <em>two</em> 1000 km by 1000 km squares in the desert.</p><p>Fortunately, the Sahara is not the only desert, so maybe it‚Äôs more relevant to chop the world into smaller regions, and ask what area is needed in each region‚Äôs local desert. So, focusing on Europe, ‚Äúwhat area is required in the North Sahara to supply <em>everyone in Europe and North Africa</em> with an average European‚Äôs power consumption? Taking the population of Europe and North Africa to be 1 billion, the area required drops to 340 000 km<sup>2</sup>, which corresponds to a square <strong>600 km by 600 km</strong>. This area is equal to one Germany, to 1.4 United Kingdoms, or to <strong>16 Waleses</strong>.</p><p>The UK‚Äôs share of this 16-Wales area would be one Wales: a 145 km by 145 km square in the Sahara would provide all the UK‚Äôs current primary energy consumption. These squares are shown in figure 25.5. Notice that while the yellow square may look ‚Äúlittle‚Äù compared with Africa, it does have the same area as Germany.</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure427.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 25.5</span>. The celebrated little square. This map shows a square of size 600 km by 600 km in Africa, and another in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Iraq. Concentrating solar power facilities completely filling one such square would provide enough power to give 1 billion people the average European‚Äôs consumption of 125 kWh/d. The area of one square is the same as the area of Germany, and 16 times the area of Wales. Within each big square is a smaller 145 km by 145 km square showing the area required in the Sahara ‚Äì one Wales ‚Äì to supply all British power consumption.<h3 id="the-desertec-plan">The DESERTEC plan</h3><p>An organization called DESERTEC [<a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 " href="http://www.desertec.org/"><span class="websitetitle">www.desertec.org</span></a>] is promoting a plan to use concentrating solar power in sunny Mediterranean countries, and high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission lines (figure 25.7) to deliver the power to cloudier northern parts. HVDC technology has been in use since 1954 to transmit power both through overhead lines and through submarine cables (such as the interconnector between France and England). It is already used to transmit electricity over 1000-km distances in South Africa, China, America, Canada, Brazil, and Congo. <sup id="fnref-2"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap25/#fn-2">2</a></sup> A typical 500 kV line can transmit a power of 2 GW. A pair of HVDC lines in Brazil transmits 6.3 GW.</p><p>HVDC is preferred over traditional high-voltage AC lines because less physical hardware is needed, less land area is needed, and the power losses of HVDC are smaller. The power losses on a 3500 km-long HVDC line, including conversion from AC to DC and back, would be about 15%. <sup id="fnref-3"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap25/#fn-3">3</a></sup> A further advantage of HVDC systems is that they help stabilize the electricity networks to which they are connected.</p><p>In the DESERTEC plans, the prime areas to exploit are coastal areas, because concentrating solar power stations that are near to the sea can deliver desalinated water as a by-product ‚Äì valuable for human use, and for agriculture.</p><p>Table 25.6 shows DESERTEC‚Äôs estimates of the potential power that could be produced in countries in Europe and North Africa. The ‚Äúeconomic potential‚Äù adds up to more than enough to supply 125 kWh per day to 1 billion people.

Laying a high-voltage DC link between Finland and Estonia. A pair of these cables transmit a power of 350 MW. Photo: ABB.<p>Let‚Äôs try to convey on a map what a realistic plan could look like.

(Greater London has an area of 1580 km<sup>2</sup>; the M25 orbital motorway around London encloses an area of 2300 km<sup>2</sup>.) Let‚Äôs call each facility a <em>blob</em>. Imagine that in each of these blobs, half the area is devoted to concentrating power stations with an average power density of 15 W/m<sup>2</sup>, leaving space around for agriculture, buildings, railways, roads, pipelines, and cables. Allowing for 10% transmission loss between the blob and the consumer, each of these blobs generates an average power of 10 GW. Figure 25.8 shows some blobs to scale on a map. To give a sense of the scale of these blobs I‚Äôve dropped a few in Britain too. <em>Four</em> of these blobs would have an output roughly equal to Britain‚Äôs total electricity consumption (16 kWh/d per person for 60 million people). <em>Sixty-five</em> blobs would provide all one billion people in Europe and North Africa with 16 kWh/d per person.

Presumably in the desert the same panels would deliver 40 W/m<sup>2</sup>. So how come the concentrating solar power stations deliver only 15‚Äì20 W/m<sup>2</sup>? Surely concentrating power should be even better than plain flat panels?</h4><p>Good question. The short answer is no. Concentrating solar power does not achieve a better power per unit land area than flat panels. The concentrating contraption has to track the sun, otherwise the sunlight won‚Äôt be focused right; once you start packing land with sun-tracking contraptions, you have to leave gaps between them; lots of sunlight falls through the gaps and is lost. The reason that people nevertheless make concentrating solar power systems is that, today, flat photovoltaic panels are very expensive, and concentrating systems are cheaper. The concentrating people‚Äôs goal is not to make systems with big power per unit land area. Land area is cheap (they assume). The goal is to deliver big power per dollar.</p><h4 id="but-if-flat-panels-have-bigger-power-density-why-dont-you-describe-covering-the-sahara-desert-with-them">But if flat panels have bigger power density, why don‚Äôt you describe covering the Sahara desert with them?</h4><p>Because I am trying to discuss practical options for large-scale sustainable power production for Europe and North Africa by 2050. My guess is that by 2050, mirrors will still be cheaper than photovoltaic panels, so concentrating solar power is the technology on which we should focus.</p><h4 id="what-about-solar-chimneys">What about solar chimneys?</h4><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure210.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 25.10</span>.

Power is extracted from the air-flow by turbines at the base of the chimney. Solar chimneys are fairly simple to build, but they don‚Äôt deliver a very impressive power per unit area. A pilot plant in Manzanares, Spain operated for seven years between 1982 and 1989. The chimney had a height of 195 m and a diameter of 10 m; the collector had a diameter of 240 m, and its roof had 6000 m<sup>2</sup> of glass and 40 000 m<sup>2</sup> of transparent plastic. It generated 44 MWh per year, which corresponds to a power per unit area of <span class="green">0.1 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>. Theoretically, the bigger the collector and the taller the chimney, the bigger the power density of a solar chimney becomes. The engineers behind Manzanares reckon that, at a site with a solar radiation of 2300 kWh/m<sup>2</sup> per year (262 W/m<sup>2</sup>), a 1000 m-high tower surrounded by a 7 km-diameter collector could generate 680 GWh per year, an average power of 78 MW. That‚Äôs a power per unit area of about <span class="green">1.6 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>, which is similar to the power per unit area of windfarms in Britain, and one tenth of the power per unit area I said concentrating solar power stations would deliver. It‚Äôs claimed that solar chimneys could generate electricity at a price similar to that of conventional power stations. I suggest that countries that have enough land and sunshine to spare should host a big bake-off contest between solar chimneys and concentrating solar power, to be funded by oil-producing and oil-consuming countries.</p><h4 id="what-about-getting-power-from-iceland-where-geothermal-power-and-hydroelectricity-are-so-plentiful">What about getting power from Iceland, where geothermal power and hydroelectricity are so plentiful?</h4><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure211.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 25.11</span>. More geothermal power in Iceland. Photo by Rosie Ward.<p>Indeed, Iceland already effectively exports energy by powering industries that make energy-intensive products. Iceland produces nearly one ton of aluminium per citizen per year, for example<!-- -->!<!-- --> So from Iceland‚Äôs point of view, there are great profits to be made. But can Iceland save Europe? I would be surprised if Iceland‚Äôs power production could be scaled up enough to make sizeable electricity exports even to Britain alone. As a benchmark, let‚Äôs compare with the England‚ÄìFrance Interconnector, which can deliver up to 2 GW across the English Channel. That maximum power is equivalent to 0.8 kWh per day per person in the UK, roughly 5% of British average electricity consumption. Iceland‚Äôs average geothermal electricity generation is just 0.3 GW, which is less than 1% of Britain‚Äôs average electricity consumption. Iceland‚Äôs average electricity production is 1.1 GW. <sup id="fnref-6"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap25/#fn-6">6</a></sup> So to create a link sending power equal to the capacity of the French interconnector, Iceland would have to <em>triple</em> its electricity production. To provide us with 4 kWh per day per person (roughly what Britain gets from its own nuclear power stations), Iceland‚Äôs electricity production would have to increase <em>ten-fold</em>. It is probably a good idea to build interconnectors to Iceland, but don‚Äôt expect them to deliver more than a small contribution.</p><h2 id="notes-and-further-reading">Notes and further reading</h2><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure212.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 25.12</span>.

My sources for this number are two companies making concentrating solar power for deserts. <a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 " href="http://www.stirlingenergy.com"><span class="websitetitle">www.stirlingenergy.com</span></a> says one of its dishes with a 25 kW Stirling engine at its focus can generate 60 000 kWh/y in a favourable desert location. They could be packed at a concentration of one dish per 500 m<sup>2</sup>. That‚Äôs an average power of <span class="green">14 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>. They say that solar dish Stirling makes the best use of land area, in terms of energy delivered. <a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 " href="http://www.ausra.com/"><span class="websitetitle">www.ausra.com</span></a> uses flat mirrors to heat water to 285 ¬∞C and drive a steam turbine. The heated, pressurized water can be stored in deep metal-lined caverns to allow power generation at night. Describing a ‚Äú240 MW(e)‚Äù plant proposed for Australia (Mills and Li√àvre, 2004), the designers claim that 3.5 km<sup>2</sup> of mirrors would deliver 1.2 TWh(e); that‚Äôs 38 W/m<sup>2</sup> of mirror. To find the power per unit land area, we need to allow for the gaps between the mirrors. Ausra say they need a 153 km by 153 km square in the desert to supply all US electric power (Mills and Morgan, 2008). Total US electricity is 3600 TWh/y, so they are claiming a power per unit land area of <span class="green">18 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>. This technology goes by the name <em>compact linear fresnel reflector</em> (Mills and Morrison, 2000; Mills et al., 2004; Mills and Morgan, 2008). Incidentally, rather than ‚Äúconcentrating solar power,‚Äù the company Ausra prefers to use the term <em>solar thermal electricity</em> (STE); they emphasize the benefits of thermal storage, in contrast to concentrating photovoltaics, which don‚Äôt come with a natural storage option. Trieb and Knies (2004), who are strong proponents of concentrating solar power, project that the alternative concentrating solar power technologies would have powers per unit land area in the following ranges: parabolic troughs, <span class="green">14‚Äì19 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>; linear fresnel collector, <span class="green">19‚Äì28 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>; tower with heliostats, <span class="green">9‚Äì14 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>; stirling dish, <span class="green">9‚Äì14 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>. There are three European demonstration plants for concentrating solar power. Andasol ‚Äì using parabolic troughs; Sol√∫car PS10, a tower near Seville; and Solartres, a tower using molten salt for heat storage. The Andasol parabolictrough system shown in figure 25.4 is predicted to deliver 10 W/m<sup>2</sup>. Sol√∫car‚Äôs ‚Äú11 MW‚Äù solar tower has 624 mirrors, each 121 m<sup>2</sup>. The mirrors concentrate sunlight to a radiation density of up to 650 kW/m<sup>2</sup>. The receiver receives a peak power of 55 MW. The power station can store 20 MWh of thermal energy, allowing it to keep going during 50 minutes of cloudiness. It was expected to generate 24.2 GWh of electricity per year, and it occupies 55 hectares. That‚Äôs an average power per unit land area of <span class="green">5 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>. (Source: Abengoa Annual Report 2003.) Solartres will occupy 142 hectares and is expected to produce 96.4 GWh per year; that‚Äôs a power density of <span class="green">8 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>.
