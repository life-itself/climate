Chapter C allows us to answer questions such as ‚Äúwould air travel consume significantly less energy if we travelled in slower planes?‚Äù The answer is <strong>no</strong>: in contrast to wheeled vehicles, which can get more efficient the slower they go, planes are already almost as energy-efficient as they could possibly be.

The full 747 has an energy cost of <span class="mauve">42 kWh per 100 p-km</span>. So both planes are twice as fuel-efficient as a single-occupancy car.

Flying creates other greenhouse gases in addition to CO<sub>2</sub>, such as water and ozone, and indirect greenhouse gases, such as nitrous oxides. If you want to estimate your carbon footprint in tons of CO<sub>2</sub>equivalent, then you should take the actual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of your flights and bump them up two- or three-fold.

Photograph by Adrian Pingstone.<p>What about short-haul flights? In 2007, Ryanair, ‚ÄúEurope‚Äôs greenest airline,‚Äù delivered transportation at a cost of <span class="darkred">37 kWh per 100 p-km</span> [<a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 " href="http://tinyurl.com/3exmgv"><span class="websitetitle">3exmgv</span></a>]. This means that flying across Europe with Ryanair has much the same energy cost as having all the passengers drive to their destination in cars, two to a car. (For an indication of what other airlines might be delivering, Ryanair‚Äôs fuel burn rate in 2000, before their environment-friendly investments, was above <span class="darkred">73 kWh per 100 p-km</span>.) London to Rome is 1430 km; London to Malaga is 1735 km. So a round-trip to Rome with the greenest airline has an energy cost of 1050 kWh, and a round-trip to Malaga costs 1270 kWh. If you pop over to Rome and to Malaga once per year, your average power consumption is 6.3 kWh/d with the greenest airline, and perhaps 12 kWh/d with a less green one.</p><p>What about frequent flyers? To get a silver frequent flyer card from an intercontinental airline, it seems one must fly around 25 000 miles per year in economy class. That‚Äôs about 60 kWh per day, if we scale up the opening numbers from this chapter and assume planes are 80% full.</p><p>Here are some additional figures from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [<a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 " href="http://tinyurl.com/yrnmum"><span class="websitetitle">yrnmum</span></a>]: a full 747-400 travelling 10 000 km with low-density seating (262 seats) has an energy consumption of <span class="darkred">50 kWh per 100 p-km</span>. In a high-density seating configuration (568 seats) and travelling 4000 km, the <span id="page37">same plane</span> has an energy consumption of <span class="darkred">22 kWh per 100 p-km</span>.

Planes today are not completely full. Airlines are proud if their average fullness is 80%. Easyjet planes are 85% full on average. (Source: <span class="websitetitle">thelondonpaper</span> Tuesday 16th January, 2007.) An 80%-full 747 uses about 53 kWh per 100 passenger-km.<a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-backref" href="/without-hot-air/chap05/#fnref-1">‚Ü©</a></li><li id="fn-2"><em><span id="note35">No redesign</span> of a plane is going to radically improve its efficiency.</em> Actually, the Advisory Council for Aerospace Research in Europe (ACARE) target is for an overall 50% reduction in fuel burned per passenger-km by 2020 (relative to a 2000 baseline), with 15‚Äì20% improvement expected in engine efficiency. As of 2006, Rolls Royce is half way to this engine target [<a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 " href="http://tinyurl.com/36w5gz"><span class="websitetitle">36w5gz</span></a>]. Dennis Bushnell, chief scientist at NASA‚Äôs Langley Research Center, seems to agree with my overall assessment of prospects for efficiency improvements in aviation. The aviation industry is mature. ‚ÄúThere is not much left to gain except by the glacial accretion of a per cent here and there over long time periods.‚Äù (New Scientist, 24 February 2007, page 33.)
