It takes three times as much work to enrich uranium from its natural state to 5% LEU as it does to enrich LEU to 90% HEU. The nuclear power industry measures these energy requirements in a unit called the separative work unit (SWU). To produce a kilogram of <sup>235</sup>U as HEU takes 232 SWU. To make 1 kg of <sup>235</sup>U as LEU (in 22.7 kg of LEU) takes about 151 SWU. In both cases one starts from natural uranium (0.71% 235U) and discards depleted uranium containing 0.25% <sup>235</sup>U. The commercial nuclear fuel market values an SWU at about $100. It takes about 100 000 SWU of enriched uranium to fuel a typical 1000 MW commercial nuclear reactor for a year. Two uranium enrichment methods are currently in commercial use: gaseous diffusion and gas centrifuge. The gaseous diffusion process consumes about 2500 kWh per SWU, while modern gas centrifuge plants require only about 50 kWh per SWU.

A modern centrifuge produces about 3 SWU per year. The USA’s production of 994 tons of highly-enriched uranium (the USA’s total, 1945–1996) cost 230 million SWU, which works out to 0.1 kWh/d per person (assuming 250 million Americans, and using 2500 kWh/SWU as the cost of diffusion enrichment).<a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-backref" href="/without-hot-air/chap17/#fnref-4">↩</a></li></ol></div></section></article></main><footer class="flex items-center justify-center w-full h-24 border-t"><a class="flex items-center justify-center" href="https://vercel.com?utm_source=create-next-app&amp;utm_medium=default-template&amp;utm_campaign=create-next-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Project of<img src="/life-itself-logo.svg" alt="Life Itself Logo" class="h-12 block"/></a></footer></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"source":{"compiledSource":"var u=Object.defineProperty,c=Object.defineProperties;var m=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors;var r=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols;var o=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty,s=Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable;var l=(a,n,t)=\u003en in a?u(a,n,{enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0,value:t}):a[n]=t,e=(a,n)=\u003e{for(var t in n||(n={}))o.call(n,t)\u0026\u0026l(a,t,n[t]);if(r)for(var t of r(n))s.call(n,t)\u0026\u0026l(a,t,n[t]);return a},p=(a,n)=\u003ec(a,m(n));var h=(a,n)=\u003e{var t={};for(var i in a)o.call(a,i)\u0026\u0026n.indexOf(i)\u003c0\u0026\u0026(t[i]=a[i]);if(a!=null\u0026\u0026r)for(var i of r(a))n.indexOf(i)\u003c0\u0026\u0026s.call(a,i)\u0026\u0026(t[i]=a[i]);return t};const layoutProps={},MDXLayout=\"wrapper\";function MDXContent(t){var i=t,{components:a}=i,n=h(i,[\"components\"]);return mdx(MDXLayout,p(e(e({},layoutProps),n),{components:a,mdxType:\"MDXLayout\"}),mdx(\"h1\",e({},{id:\"17-public-services\"}),\"17 Public services\"),mdx(\"p\",null,mdx(\"img\",e({parentName:\"p\"},{src:\"/img/without-hot-air/figure1211.gif\",alt:null})),`\n`,mdx(\"img\",e({parentName:\"p\"},{src:\"/img/without-hot-air/figure122.gif\",alt:null}))),mdx(\"p\",null,mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.\")),mdx(\"p\",null,mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"This world in arms is not spending money alone.

It takes three times as much work to enrich uranium from its natural state to 5% LEU as it does to enrich LEU to 90% HEU. The nuclear power industry measures these energy requirements in a unit called the separative work unit (SWU). To produce a kilogram of \",mdx(\"sup\",null,\"235\"),\"U as HEU takes 232 SWU. To make 1 kg of \",mdx(\"sup\",null,\"235\"),\"U as LEU (in 22.7 kg of LEU) takes about 151 SWU. In both cases one starts from natural uranium (0.71% 235U) and discards depleted uranium containing 0.25% \",mdx(\"sup\",null,\"235\"),\"U. The commercial nuclear fuel market values an SWU at about $100. It takes about 100 000 SWU of enriched uranium to fuel a typical 1000 MW commercial nuclear reactor for a year. Two uranium enrichment methods are currently in commercial use: gaseous diffusion and gas centrifuge. The gaseous diffusion process consumes about 2500 kWh per SWU, while modern gas centrifuge plants require only about 50 kWh per SWU.
