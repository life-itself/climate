The total energy of the USA‚Äôs nuclear arsenal today is 2400 megatons, contained in 10 000 warheads. In the good old days when folks really took defence seriously, the arsenal‚Äôs energy was 20 000 megatons. These bombs, if used, would have delivered an energy of about 100 000 kWh per American.

It takes three times as much work to enrich uranium from its natural state to 5% LEU as it does to enrich LEU to 90% HEU. The nuclear power industry measures these energy requirements in a unit called the separative work unit (SWU). To produce a kilogram of <sup>235</sup>U as HEU takes 232 SWU. To make 1 kg of <sup>235</sup>U as LEU (in 22.7 kg of LEU) takes about 151 SWU. In both cases one starts from natural uranium (0.71% 235U) and discards depleted uranium containing 0.25% <sup>235</sup>U. The commercial nuclear fuel market values an SWU at about $100. It takes about 100 000 SWU of enriched uranium to fuel a typical 1000 MW commercial nuclear reactor for a year. Two uranium enrichment methods are currently in commercial use: gaseous diffusion and gas centrifuge. The gaseous diffusion process consumes about 2500 kWh per SWU, while modern gas centrifuge plants require only about 50 kWh per SWU.

A modern centrifuge produces about 3 SWU per year. The USA‚Äôs production of 994 tons of highly-enriched uranium (the USA‚Äôs total, 1945‚Äì1996) cost 230 million SWU, which works out to 0.1 kWh/d per person (assuming 250 million Americans, and using 2500 kWh/SWU as the cost of diffusion enrichment).<a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-backref" href="/without-hot-air/chap17/#fnref-4">‚Ü©</a></li></ol></div></section></article></main><footer class="flex items-center justify-center w-full h-24 border-t"><a class="flex items-center justify-center" href="https://vercel.com?utm_source=create-next-app&amp;utm_medium=default-template&amp;utm_campaign=create-next-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Project of<img src="/life-itself-logo.svg" alt="Life Itself Logo" class="h-12 block"/></a></footer></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"source":{"compiledSource":"var u=Object.defineProperty,c=Object.defineProperties;var m=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors;var r=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols;var o=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty,s=Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable;var l=(a,n,t)=\u003en in a?u(a,n,{enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0,value:t}):a[n]=t,e=(a,n)=\u003e{for(var t in n||(n={}))o.call(n,t)\u0026\u0026l(a,t,n[t]);if(r)for(var t of r(n))s.call(n,t)\u0026\u0026l(a,t,n[t]);return a},p=(a,n)=\u003ec(a,m(n));var h=(a,n)=\u003e{var t={};for(var i in a)o.call(a,i)\u0026\u0026n.indexOf(i)\u003c0\u0026\u0026(t[i]=a[i]);if(a!=null\u0026\u0026r)for(var i of r(a))n.indexOf(i)\u003c0\u0026\u0026s.call(a,i)\u0026\u0026(t[i]=a[i]);return t};const layoutProps={},MDXLayout=\"wrapper\";function MDXContent(t){var i=t,{components:a}=i,n=h(i,[\"components\"]);return mdx(MDXLayout,p(e(e({},layoutProps),n),{components:a,mdxType:\"MDXLayout\"}),mdx(\"h1\",e({},{id:\"17-public-services\"}),\"17 Public services\"),mdx(\"p\",null,mdx(\"img\",e({parentName:\"p\"},{src:\"/img/without-hot-air/figure1211.gif\",alt:null})),`\n`,mdx(\"img\",e({parentName:\"p\"},{src:\"/img/without-hot-air/figure122.gif\",alt:null}))),mdx(\"p\",null,mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.\")),mdx(\"p\",null,mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"This world in arms is not spending money alone.
