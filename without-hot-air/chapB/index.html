‚ÄÉmass = density √ó volume</p><p>To estimate the energy in wind, let‚Äôs imagine holding up a hoop with area <em>A</em>, facing the wind whose speed is <em>v</em>. Consider the mass of air that passes through that hoop in one second. Here‚Äôs a picture of that mass of air just before it passes through the hoop:</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure501.gif"/></p><p>And here‚Äôs a picture of the same mass of air one second later:</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure502.gif"/></p><p>The mass of this piece of air is the product of its density <em>œÅ</em>, its area <em>A</em>, and its length, which is <em>v</em> times <em>t</em>, where <em>t</em> is one second.</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure503.gif"/></p><p>The kinetic energy of this piece of air is</p><p>[\begin{matrix}
{\frac{1}{2}mv^{2} = \frac{1}{2}\rho Avt\ v^{2} = \frac{1}{2}\rho Atv^{3}} <!-- -->\<!-- -->
\end{matrix}]</p><p>So the power of the wind, for an area <em>A</em> ‚Äì that is, the kinetic energy passing across that area per unit time ‚Äì is</p><p>[\begin{matrix}
{\frac{\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}}{t} = \frac{1}{2}\rho Av^{3}} <!-- -->\<!-- -->
\end{matrix}]</p><p>This formula may look familiar ‚Äì we derived an identical expression when we were discussing the power requirement of a moving car.</p><p>What‚Äôs a typical wind speed? On a windy day, a cyclist really notices the wind direction; if the wind is behind you, you can go much faster than normal; the speed of such a wind is therefore comparable to the typical speed of the cyclist, which is, let‚Äôs say, 21 km per hour (13 miles per hour, or 6 metres per second). In Cambridge, the wind is only occasionally this big. Nevertheless, let‚Äôs use this as a typical British figure (and bear in mind that we may need to revise our estimates).</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure260.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure B.2.</span> Flow of air past a windmill.

On a breezy day, this windmill was producing 60 kW, (1400 kWh per day). Photo by Philip Banks.<p>The density of air is about 1.3 kg per m<sup>3</sup>. (I usually round this to 1 kg per m<sup>3</sup>, which is easier to remember, although I haven‚Äôt done so here.) Then the typical power of the wind per square metre of hoop is</p><p>[\begin{matrix}
{\frac{1}{2}\rho v^{3} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{1.3\ kg/}\text{m}^{\text{3}} \times \left( \text{6\ m/s} \right)^{\text{3}} = \text{140\ W/}\text{m}^{\text{2}}} <!-- -->\<!-- -->
\end{matrix}]</p><p>Not all of this energy can be extracted by a windmill. The windmill slows the air down quite a lot, but it has to leave the air with <em>some</em> kinetic energy, otherwise that slowed-down air would get in the way. Figure B.2 is a cartoon of the actual flow past a windmill. The maximum fraction of the incoming energy that can be extracted by a disc-like windmill was worked out by a German physicist called Albert Betz <a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 " href="/without-hot-air/chapB/#chBn01"><span class="darkred">[1]</span></a> in 1919. If the departing wind speed is one third of the arriving wind speed, the power extracted is 16/27 of the total power in the wind. 16/27 is 0.59. In practice let‚Äôs guess that a windmill might be 50% efficient. In fact, real windmills are designed with particular wind speeds in mind; if the wind speed is significantly greater than the turbine‚Äôs ideal speed, it has to be switched off.</p><p>As an example, let‚Äôs assume a diameter of <em>d</em> = 25m, and a hub height of 32 m, which is roughly the size of the lone windmill above the city of Wellington, New Zealand (figure B.3). The power of a single windmill is</p><p>[\begin{matrix}
<!-- -->\<!-- -->

{= \text{34\ kW}} <!-- -->\<!-- -->
\end{matrix}]</p><p>Indeed, when I visited this windmill on a very breezy day, its meter showed it was generating 60 kW.</p><p>To estimate how much power we can get from wind, we need to decide how big our windmills are going to be, and how close together we can pack them.</p><p>How densely could such windmills be packed? Too close and the upwind ones will cast wind-shadows on the downwind ones. Experts say that windmills can‚Äôt be spaced closer than 5 times their diameter without losing significant power. At this spacing, the <span id="power">power</span> that windmills can generate per unit land area is</p><p>[\begin{matrix}

Notice that our answer does not depend on the diameter of the windmill. The <em>ds</em> cancelled because bigger windmills have to be spaced further apart. Bigger windmills might be a good idea in order to catch bigger windspeeds that exist higher up (the taller a windmill is, the bigger the wind speed it encounters), or because of economies of scale, but those are the only reasons for preferring big windmills.</p><p>Power per unit area</p><p>wind farm (speed 6 m/s)</p><p>2 W/m<sup>2</sup></p><span class="figurenumber">Table B.5.</span> Facts worth remembering: wind farms.<p>This calculation depended sensitively on our estimate of the windspeed.

Speeds were measured at the standard weatherman‚Äôs height of 10 metres. Averages are over the period 1971‚Äì2000.<p>On the other hand, to estimate the typical power, we shouldn‚Äôt take the mean wind speed and cube it; rather, we should find the mean cube of the windspeed. The average of the cube is bigger than the cube of the average. But if we start getting into these details, things get even more complicated, because real wind turbines don‚Äôt actually deliver a power proportional to wind-speed cubed. Rather, they typically have just a range of wind-speeds within which they deliver the ideal power; at higher or lower speeds real wind turbines deliver less than the ideal power.</p><h3 id="variation-of-wind-speed-with-height">Variation of wind speed with height</h3><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure266.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure B.7.</span> Top: Two models of wind speed and wind power as a function of height.

Bottom: The power density (the power per unit of upright area) according to each of these models.<p>Taller windmills see higher wind speeds. The way that wind speed increases with height is complicated and depends on the roughness of the surrounding terrain and on the time of day.
