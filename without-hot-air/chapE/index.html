As day turns to night, and seasons pass, the temperature difference Œî<em>T</em> changes; we can think of a long period as being chopped into lots of small durations, during each of which the temperature difference is roughly constant. From duration to duration, the temperature difference changes, but the Somethings don‚Äôt change. When predicting a space‚Äôs total energy loss due to conduction and ventilation over a long period we thus need to multiply two things:</p><ol><li>the sum of all the <span class="darkblue">Somethings</span> (adding <span class="darkblue">area √ó <em>U</em></span> for all walls, roofs, floors, doors, and windows, and <span class="darkblue"><sup>1</sup>‚ÅÑ<sub>3</sub><em>NV</em></span> for the volume); and</li><li>the sum of all the Temperature difference √ó duration factors (for all the durations).</li></ol><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure287.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure E.4.</span> The temperature demand in Cambridge, 2006, visualized as an area on a graph of daily average temperatures. (a) Thermostat set to 20 ¬∞C, including cooling in summer; (b) winter thermostat set to 17 ¬∞C.<p>The first factor is a property of the building measured in watts per ¬∞C. I‚Äôll call this the <em>leakiness</em> of the building. (This leakiness is sometimes called the building‚Äôs <em>heat-loss coefficient</em>.) The second factor is a property of the weather; it‚Äôs often expressed as a number of ‚Äúdegree-days,‚Äù since temperature difference is measured in degrees, and days are a convenient unit for thinking about durations. For example, if your house interior is at 18 ¬∞C, and the outside temperature is 8 ¬∞C for a week, then we say that that week contributed 10 √ó 7 = 70 degree-days to the (Œî<em>T</em> √óduration) sum. I‚Äôll call the sum of all the (Œî<em>T</em> √ó duration) factors the <em>temperature demand</em> of a period.</p><p>energy lost = leakiness √ó temperature demand.</p><p>We can reduce our energy loss by reducing the leakiness of the building, or by reducing our temperature demand, or both. The next two sections look more closely at these two factors, using a house in Cambridge as a case-study.</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure288.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure E.5.</span> Temperature demand in Cambridge, in degree-days per year, as a function of thermostat setting (¬∞C). Reducing the winter thermostat from 20 ¬∞C to 17 ¬∞C reduces the temperature demand of heating by 30%, from 3188 to 2265 degree-days. Raising the summer thermostat from 20 ¬∞C to 23 ¬∞C reduces the temperature demand of cooling by 82%, from 91 to 16 degree-days.<p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure289.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure E.6.</span> The temperature demand in Cambridge, 2006, replotted in units of degree-days per day, also known as degrees. In these units, the temperature demand is just the average of the temperature difference between inside and outside.<p>There is a third factor we must also discuss. The lost energy is replenished by the building‚Äôs heating system, and by other sources of energy such as the occupants, their gadgets, their cookers, and the sun. Focussing on the heating system, the energy <em>delivered</em> by the heating is not the same as the energy <em>consumed</em> by the heating. They are related by the <em>coefficient of performance</em> of the heating system.</p><p>energy consumed = energy delivered/coefficient of performance.</p><p>For a condensing boiler burning natural gas, for example, the coefficient of performance is 90%, because 10% of the energy is lost up the chimney.</p><p>To summarise, we can reduce the energy consumption of a building in three ways:</p><ol><li>by reducing temperature demand;</li><li>by reducing leakiness; or</li><li>by increasing the coefficient of performance.</li></ol><p>We now quantify the potential of these options. (A fourth option ‚Äì increasing the building‚Äôs incidental heat gains, especially from the sun ‚Äì may also be useful, but I won‚Äôt address it here.)</p><h3 id="temperature-demand">Temperature demand</h3><p>We can visualize the temperature demand nicely on a graph of external temperature versus time (figure E.4). For a building held at a temperature of 20 ¬∞C, the total temperature demand is the <em>area</em> between the horizontal line at 20 ¬∞C and the external temperature. In figure E.4a, we see that, for one year in Cambridge, holding the temperature at 20 ¬∞C year-round had a temperature demand of 3188 degree-days of heating and 91 degree-days of cooling. These pictures allow us easily to assess the effect of turning down the thermostat and living without air-conditioning. Turning the winter thermostat down to 17 ¬∞C, the temperature demand for heating drops from 3188 degree-days to 2265 degree-days (figure E.4b), which corresponds to a 30% reduction in heating demand. Turning the thermostat down to 15 ¬∞C reduces the temperature demand from 3188 to 1748 degree days, a 45% reduction.</p><p>These calculations give us a ballpark indication of the benefit of turning down thermostats, but will give an exact prediction only if we take into account two details: first, buildings naturally absorb energy from the sun, boosting the inside above the outside temperature, even without any heating; and second, the occupants and their gadget companions emit heat, so further cutting down the artificial heating requirements. The temperature demand of a location, as conventionally expressed in degree-days, is a bit of an unwieldy thing. I find it hard to remember numbers like ‚Äú3500 degree-days.‚Äù And academics may find the degree-day a distressing unit, since they already have another meaning for degree days (one involving dressing up in gowns and mortar boards). We can make this quantity more meaningful and perhaps easier to work with by dividing it by 365, the number of days in the year, obtaining the temperature demand in ‚Äúdegree-days per day,‚Äù or, if you prefer, in plain ‚Äúdegrees.‚Äù Figure E.6 shows this replotted temperature demand. Expressed this way, the temperature demand is simply the <em>average</em> temperature difference between inside and outside. The highlighted temperature demands are: 8.7 ¬∞C, for a thermostat setting of 20 ¬∞C; 6.2 ¬∞C, for a setting of 17 ¬∞C; and 4.8 ¬∞C, for a setting of 15 ¬∞C.</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure290.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure E.7.</span> My house.<h3 id="leakiness--example-my-house">Leakiness ‚Äì example: my house</h3><p>My house is a three-bedroom semi-detached house built about 1940 (figure E.7).

I‚Äôve treated the central wall of the semi-detached house as a perfect insulating wall, but this may be wrong if the gap between the adjacent houses is actually well-ventilated. I‚Äôve highlighted the parameters that I altered after 2006, in modifications to be described shortly.<p>To compare the leakinesses of two buildings that have different floor areas, we can divide the leakiness by the floor area; this gives the <em>heat-loss parameter</em> of the building, which is measured in W/¬∞C/m<sup>2</sup>.

With the thermostat at 19 ¬∞C, the temperature demand in 2006 was 2866 degree-days. The average rate of heat loss, if the house is always held at 19 ¬∞C, is therefore:</p><p>7.7 kWh/d/¬∞C √ó 2866 degree-days/y/(365 days/y) = 61 kWh/d.</p><p>Turning the thermostat down to 17 ¬∞C, the average rate of heat loss drops to 48 kWh/d.

The glazing modifications (new U-value 1.6‚Äì1.8) should reduce the conductive leakiness by 23 W/¬∞C, and the ventilation leakiness by something like 24 W/¬∞C.

As figure 21.4 showed, my gas consumption has gone down from 40 kWh/d to 13 kWh/d ‚Äì a reduction of 67%.</p><h5 id="leakiness-reduction-by-internal-wall-coverings">Leakiness reduction by internal wall-coverings</h5><p>Can you reduce your walls‚Äô leakiness by covering the <em>inside</em> of the wall with insulation? The answer is yes, but there may be two complications. First, the thickness of internal covering is bigger than you might expect. To transform an existing nine-inch solid brick wall (U-value 2.2 W/m<sup>2</sup>/K) into a decent 0.30 W/m<sup>2</sup>/K wall, roughly 6 cm of insulated lining board is required. [<a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 " href="http://tinyurl.com/65h3cb"><span class="websitetitle">65h3cb</span></a>] Second, condensation may form on the hidden surface of such internal insulation layers, leading to damp problems.</p><p>If you‚Äôre not looking for such a big reduction in wall leakiness, you can get by with a thinner internal covering. For example, you can buy 1.8-cmthick insulated wallboards with a U-value of 1.7 W/m<sup>2</sup>/K. With these over the existing wall, the U-value would be reduced from 2.2 W/m<sup>2</sup>/K to:</p><p>[\left. 1/{\left( {\frac{1}{2.2} + \frac{1}{1.7}} \right) \approx 1\text{~W/}\text{m}^{\text{2}}\text{/K.}} \right.]</p><p>Definitely a worthwhile reduction.</p><h2 id="air-exchange">Air-exchange</h2><p>Once a building is really well insulated, the principal loss of heat will be through ventilation (air changes) rather than through conduction. The heat loss through ventilation can be reduced by transferring the heat from the outgoing air to the incoming air. Remarkably, a great deal of this heat can indeed be transferred without any additional energy being required. The trick is to use a nose, as discovered by natural selection. A nose warms incoming air by cooling down outgoing air. There‚Äôs a temperature gradient along the nose; the walls of a nose are coldest near the nostrils. The longer your nose, the better it works as a counter-current heat exchanger. In nature‚Äôs noses, the direction of the air-flow usually alternates. Another way to organize a nose is to have two air-passages, one for in-flow and one for out-flow, separate from the point of view of air, but tightly coupled with each other so that heat can easily flow between the two passages. This is how the noses work in buildings. It‚Äôs conventional to call these noses heat-exchangers.</p><h2 id="an-energy-efficient-house">An energy-efficient house</h2><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure292.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure E.10.</span> The Heatkeeper Serrekunda.<p>In 1984, an energy consultant, Alan Foster, built an energy-efficient house near Cambridge; he kindly gave me his thorough measurements. The house is a timber-framed bungalow based on a Scandinavian ‚ÄúHeatkeeper Serrekunda‚Äù design (figure E.10), with a floor area of 140 m<sup>2</sup>, composed of three bedrooms, a study, two bathrooms, a living room, a kitchen, and a lobby. The wooden outside walls were supplied in kit form by a Scottish company, and the main parts of the house took only a few days to build.</p><p>The walls are 30 cm thick and have a U-value of 0.28 W/m<sup>2</sup>/¬∞C. From the inside out, they consist of 13 mm of plasterboard, 27 mm airspace, a vapour barrier, 8 mm of plywood, 90 mm of rockwool, 12 mm of bitumen-impregnated fibreboard, 50 mm cavity, and 103 mm of brick. The ceiling construction is similar with 100‚Äì200 mm of rockwool insulation. The ceiling has a U-value of 0.27 W/m<sup>2</sup>/¬∞C, and the floor, 0.22 W/m<sup>2</sup>/¬∞C. The windows are double-glazed (U-value 2 W/m<sup>2</sup>/¬∞C), with the inner panes‚Äô outer surfaces specially coated to reduce radiation. The windows are arranged to give substantial solar gain, contributing about 30% of the house‚Äôs space-heating.</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure293.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure E.11.</span> The Heatkeeper‚Äôs heat-exchanger.<p>The house is well sealed, every door and window lined with neoprene gaskets. The house is heated by warm air pumped through floor grilles; in winter, pumps remove used air from several rooms, exhausting it to the outside, and they take in air from the loft space. The incoming air and outgoing air pass through a heat exchanger (figure E.11), which saves 60% of the heat in the extracted air. The heat exchanger is a passive device, using no energy: it‚Äôs like a big metal nose, warming the incoming air with the outgoing air. On a cold winter‚Äôs day, the outside air temperature was -8 ¬∞C, the temperature in the loft‚Äôs air intake was 0 ¬∞C, and the air coming out of the heat exchanger was at +8 ¬∞C.</p><p>For the first decade, the heat was supplied entirely by electric heaters, heating a 150-gallon heat store during the overnight economy period. More recently a gas supply was brought to the house, and the space heating is now obtained from a condensing boiler.</p><p>The heat loss through conduction and ventilation is 4.2 kWh/d/¬∞C.

This means that the PassivHaus standards are actually more stringent than the figure shows; though exactly how much more stringent depends on the fuel mix.<p>Notice that the building power consumptions, per unit floor area, are in just the same units (W/m<sup>2</sup>) as the renewable powers per unit area that we discussed in chapters 6 and 25.

But it can be significantly improved upon, by heat pumps. Whereas the condensing boiler takes chemical energy and turns 90% of it into useful heat, the heat pump takes some electrical energy and uses it to <em>move</em> heat from one place to another (for example, from outside a building to inside). Usually the amount of useful heat delivered is much bigger than the amount of electricity used. A coefficient of performance of 3 or 4 is normal.</p><h3 id="theory-of-heat-pumps">Theory of heat pumps</h3><p>Here are the formulae for the ideal efficiency of a heat pump, that is, the electrical energy required per unit of heat pumped.

Thanks to low conductivity, the ground holds heat well for a long time. But on the other hand, low conductivity means that it‚Äôs not easy to shove heat in and out of the ground rapidly. We now explore how the conductivity of the ground limits the use of ground-source heat pumps.</p><p>Consider a neighbourhood with quite a high population density. Can <em>everyone</em> use ground-source heat pumps, without using active summer replenishment (as discussed in chapter 21)? The concern is that if we all sucked heat from the ground at the same time, we might freeze the ground solid. I‚Äôm going to address this question by two calculations. First, I‚Äôll work out the natural flux of energy in and out of the ground in summer and winter. If the flux we want to suck out of the ground in winter is much bigger than these natural fluxes then we know that our sucking is going to significantly alter ground temperatures, and may thus not be feasible. For this calculation, I‚Äôll assume the ground just below the surface is held, by the combined influence of sun, air, cloud, and night sky, at a temperature that varies slowly up and down during the year (figure E.16).</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure295.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure E.16.</span> The temperature in Cambridge, 2006, and a cartoon, which says the temperature is the sum of an annual sinusoidal variation between 3 ¬∞C and 20 ¬∞C, and a daily sinusoidal variation with range up to 10.3 ¬∞C.

This diagram shows the answer for any material in terms of the <em>characteristic length-scale</em> <em>z</em><span class="smallfont1"><sub>0</sub></span> (equation (E.7)), which depends on the conductivity <em>Œ∫</em> and heat capacity <em>C</em><span class="smallfont1"><sub>V</sub></span> of the material, and on the frequency <em>œâ</em> of the external temperature variations. (We can choose to look at either daily and yearly variations using the same theory.) At a depth of 2<em>z</em><span class="smallfont1"><sub>0</sub></span>, the variations in temperature are one seventh of those at the surface, and lag them by about one third of a cycle (figure E.17).

For yearly variations and solid granite, the characteristic length-scale is <em>z</em><span class="smallfont1"><sub>0</sub></span> = 3 m.</p><p>Let‚Äôs focus on annual variations and discuss a few other materials. Characteristic length-scales for various materials are in the third column of table E.18. For damp sandy soils or concrete, the characteristic length-scale <em>z</em><span class="smallfont1"><sub>0</sub></span> is similar to that of granite ‚Äì about 2.6 m. In dry or peaty soils, the length-scale <em>z</em><span class="smallfont1"><sub>0</sub></span> is shorter ‚Äì about 1.3 m. That‚Äôs perhaps good news because it means you don‚Äôt have to dig so deep to find ground with a stable temperature. But it‚Äôs also coupled with some bad news: the natural fluxes are smaller in dry soils.</p><p>The natural flux varies during the year and has a peak value (equation (E.9)) that is smaller, the smaller the conductivity.</p><p>For the case of solid granite, the peak flux is 8 W/m<sup>2</sup>.

I suggest we take a flux in the middle of these numbers, 5 W/m<sup>2</sup>, as a useful benchmark, giving guidance about what sort of power we could expect to extract, per unit area, with a ground-source heat pump. If we suck a flux significantly smaller than 5 W/m<sup>2</sup>, the perturbation we introduce to the natural flows will be small. If on the other hand we try to suck a flux bigger than 5 W/m<sup>2</sup>, we should expect that we‚Äôll be shifting the temperature of the ground significantly away from its natural value, and such fluxes may be impossible to demand.</p><p>The population density of a typical English suburb corresponds to 160 m<sup>2</sup> per person (rows of semi-detached houses with about 400 m<sup>2</sup> per house, including pavements and streets).

Assuming a conductivity of 1.2 W/m/K (typical of damp clay soil),</p><p>[\text{Flux} = \kappa \times \frac{\Delta T}{h} = 3\text{~W/}\text{m}^{2}\text{.}]</p><p>If, as above, we assume a population density corresponding to 160 m<sup>2</sup> per person, then the maximum power per person deliverable by ground-source heat pumps, if everyone in a neighbourhood has them, is 480 W, which is 12 kWh/d per person.</p><p>So again we come to the conclusion that in a typical suburban area composed of poorly insulated houses like mine, <em>not everyone can use groundsource heat pumps</em>, unless they are careful to actively dump heat back into the ground during the summer. And in cities with higher population density, ground-source heat pumps are unlikely to be viable.</p><p>I therefore suggest air-source heat pumps are the best heating choice for most people.</p><h2 id="thermal-mass">Thermal mass</h2><p>Does increasing the thermal mass of a building help reduce its heating and cooling bills? It depends. The outdoor temperature can vary during the day by about 10 ¬∞C. A building with large thermal mass ‚Äì thick stone walls, for example ‚Äì will naturally ride out those variations in temperature, and, without heating or cooling, will have a temperature close to the average outdoor temperature. Such buildings, in the UK, need neither heating nor cooling for many months of the year. In contrast, a poorly-insulated building with low thermal mass might be judged too hot during the day and too cool at night, leading to greater expenditure on cooling and heating.</p><p>However, large thermal mass is not always a boon. If a room is occupied in winter for just a couple of hours a day (think of a lecture room for example), the energy cost of warming the room up to a comfortable temperature will be greater, the greater the room‚Äôs thermal mass. This extra invested heat will linger for longer in a thermally massive room, but if nobody is there to enjoy it, it‚Äôs wasted heat. So in the case of infrequently-used rooms it makes sense to aim for a structure with low thermal mass, and to warm that small mass rapidly when required.</p><h2 id="notes-and-further-reading">Notes and further reading</h2><span id="boxE.19"></span><p>If we assume the ground is made of solid homogenous material with conductivity <em>Œ∫</em> and heat capacity <em>C</em><sub>V</sub>, then the temperature at depth <em>z</em> below the ground and time <em>t</em> responds to the imposed temperature at the surface in accordance with the diffusion equation</p><p>[\begin{matrix}

So in the case of infrequently-used rooms it makes sense to aim for a structure with low thermal mass, and to warm that small mass rapidly when required.\"),mdx(\"h2\",e({},{id:\"notes-and-further-reading\"}),\"Notes and further reading\"),mdx(\"span\",{id:\"boxE.19\"}),mdx(\"p\",null,\"If we assume the ground is made of solid homogenous material with conductivity \",mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"\\u03BA\"),\" and heat capacity \",mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"C\"),mdx(\"sub\",null,\"V\"),\", then the temperature at depth \",mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"z\"),\" below the ground and time \",mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"t\"),\" responds to the imposed temperature at the surface in accordance with the diffusion equation\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`[\\\\begin{matrix}\n{\\\\frac{\\\\partial T\\\\left( z,t \\\\right)}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\frac{\\\\kappa}{C_{\\\\text{V}}}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^{2}T\\\\left( z,t \\\\right)}{\\\\partial z^{2}}\\\\text{.}} `,\"\\\\\",`\n\\\\end{matrix}]`),mdx(\"p\",null,\"For a sinusoidal imposed temperature with frequency \",mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"\\u03C9\"),\" and amplitude \",mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"A\"),\" at depth \",mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"z\"),\" = 0,\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`[\\\\begin{matrix}\n{T\\\\left( 0,t \\\\right) = T`,mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"{\\\\text{surface}}\\\\left( t \\\\right) = T\"),\"{\\\\text{average}} + A\\\\text{cos}\\\\left( \\\\omega t \\\\right)\\\\text{,}} \",\"\\\\\",`\n\\\\end{matrix}]`),mdx(\"p\",null,\"the resulting temperature at depth \",mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"z\"),\" and time \",mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"t\"),\" is a decaying and oscillating function\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`[\\\\begin{matrix}\n{T\\\\left( z,t \\\\right) = T`,mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"{\\\\text{average}}\\\\left( t \\\\right) + A\\\\text{e}^{- {z/z\"),\"{0}}}\\\\text{cos}\\\\left( {\\\\omega t - {z/z_{0}}} \\\\right)\\\\text{,}} \",\"\\\\\",`\n\\\\end{matrix}]`),mdx(\"p\",null,\"where \",mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"z\"),mdx(\"span\",{class:\"smallfont1\"},mdx(\"sub\",null,\"0\")),\" is the characteristic length-scale of both the decay and the oscillation,\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`[\\\\begin{matrix}\n\\\\text{(E.7)\\\\quad} \u0026 {z`,mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"{0} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2\\\\kappa}{C\"),\"{\\\\text{V}}\\\\omega}\\\\text{,}}} \",\"\\\\\",`\n\\\\end{matrix}]`),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The flux of heat (the power per unit area) at depth \",mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"z\"),\" is\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`[\\\\begin{matrix}\n{\\\\kappa\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial z} = \\\\kappa\\\\frac{A}{z`,mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"{0}}\\\\sqrt{2}\\\\text{e}^{- {z/z\"),\"{0}}}\\\\text{sin}\\\\left( {\\\\omega t - z/z_{0} - \\\\pi/4} \\\\right)} \",\"\\\\\",`\n\\\\end{matrix}\\\\text{.}]`),mdx(\"p\",null,\"For example, at the surface, the peak flux is\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`[\\\\begin{matrix}\n{\\\\kappa\\\\frac{A}{z`,mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"{0}}\\\\sqrt{2} = A\\\\sqrt{C\"),\"{\\\\text{V}}\\\\kappa\\\\omega}} \",\"\\\\\",`\n\\\\end{matrix}\\\\text{.}]`),mdx(\"span\",{class:\"figurenumber\"},\"Box E.19.\"),\" Working out the natural flux caused by sinusoidal temperature variations.\")}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n","scope":{}},"frontMatter":{}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/[...slug]","query":{"slug":["without-hot-air","chapE"]},"buildId":"02_mfuWKPLeop_kgt5UpM","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
