Let‚Äôs estimate first the energy used by taking a hot bath.</p><p>The volume of bath-water is 50 cm √ó 15 cm √ó 150 cm ‚âà 110 litre. Say the temperature of the bath is 50 ¬∞C (120 ¬∞F) and the water coming into the house is at 10 ¬∞C. The heat capacity of water, which measures how much energy is required to heat it up, is 4200 J per litre per ¬∞C. So the energy required to heat up the water by 40 ¬∞C is</p><p>4200 J/litre/¬∞C √ó 110 litre √ó 40 ¬∞C ‚âà 18 MJ ‚âà 5 kWh.</p><p>So taking a bath uses about <span class="red">5 kWh</span>.

With this supply, we can use an electric kettle to boil several litres of water in a couple of minutes. Such kettles have a power of 3 kW. Why 3 kW? Because this is the biggest power that a 230 volt outlet can deliver without the current exceeding the maximum permitted, 13 amps. In countries where the voltage is 110 volts, it takes twice as long to make a pot of tea.</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure55.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 7.3</span>.

The power of a small electric bar fire or electric fan heater is 1 kW (24 kWh per day). In winter, you might need one of these per person to keep toasty. In summer, none. So we estimate that on average one modern person <em>needs</em> to use 12 kWh per day on hot air. But most people use more than they need, keeping several rooms warm simultaneously (kitchen, living room, corridor, and bathroom, say). So a plausible consumption figure for hot air is about double that: <span class="red">24 kWh per day per person</span>.</p><p>This chapter‚Äôs companion Chapter E contains a more detailed account of where the heat is going in a building; this model makes it possible to <span id="page52">predict</span> the heat savings from turning the thermostat down, double-glazing the windows, and so forth.</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure58.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 7.7</span>.

Typical patio heaters have a power of 15 kW. So if you use one of these for a couple of hours every evening, you are using an extra <span class="red">30 kWh per day</span>.</p><p>A more modest luxury is an electric blanket.

However, this part of the book is about British energy consumption, and Britain‚Äôs temperatures provide little need for air- conditioning (figure 7.8).</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure59.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 7.8</span>. Cambridge temperature in degrees Celsius, daily (red line), and half-hourly (blue line) during 2006.<p>An economical way to get air-conditioning is an air-source heat pump. A window-mounted electric air-conditioning unit for a single room uses 0.6 kW of electricity and (by heat-exchanger) delivers 2.6 kW of cooling. To estimate how much energy someone might use in the UK, I assumed they might switch such an air-conditioning unit on for about 12 hours per day on 30 days of the year. On the days when it‚Äôs on, the air-conditioner uses 7.2 kWh.

At the time I thought I was a fairly frugal user of heating, but I wasn‚Äôt being attentive to my actual power consumption. Chapter 21 will reveal how much power I saved once I started paying attention.</p><p>Since heating is a big item in our consumption stack, let‚Äôs check my estimates against some national statistics. Nationally, the average <em>domestic</em> consumption for space heating, water, and cooking in the year 2000 was 21 kWh per day per person, and consumption in the <em>service sector</em> for heating, cooling, catering, and hot water was 8.5 kWh/d/p. <sup id="fnref-3"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap07/#fn-3">3</a></sup> For an estimate of workplace heating, let‚Äôs take the gas consumption of the University of Cambridge in 2006‚Äì7: 16 kWh/d per employee. <sup id="fnref-4"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap07/#fn-4">4</a></sup></p><p>Totting up these three numbers, a second guess for the national spend on heating is 21 + 8.5 + 16 ‚âà 45 kWh/d per person, if Cambridge University is a normal workplace.

The latent heat of vaporization of water at 15 ¬∞C is roughly 2500 kJ/kg. To obtain the daily figure in table 7.4 I assumed that one person has a load of laundry every three days, and that this sucks valuable heat from the house during the cold half of the year.
