Let’s estimate first the energy used by taking a hot bath.</p><p>The volume of bath-water is 50 cm × 15 cm × 150 cm ≈ 110 litre. Say the temperature of the bath is 50 °C (120 °F) and the water coming into the house is at 10 °C. The heat capacity of water, which measures how much energy is required to heat it up, is 4200 J per litre per °C. So the energy required to heat up the water by 40 °C is</p><p>4200 J/litre/°C × 110 litre × 40 °C ≈ 18 MJ ≈ 5 kWh.</p><p>So taking a bath uses about <span class="red">5 kWh</span>.

The hot water total at both home and work – including bathing, showering, clothes washing, cookers, kettles, microwave oven, and dishwashing – is about 12 kWh per day per person.

A big electric heater: 2 kW.<p>A clothes washer uses about 80 litres of water per load, with an energy cost of about 1 kWh if the temperature is set to 40 °C. If we use an indoor airing-cupboard instead of a tumble dryer to dry clothes, heat is still required to evaporate the water – roughly 1.5 kWh to dry one load of clothes, instead of 3 kWh. <sup id="fnref-2"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap07/#fn-2">2</a></sup></p><p>Totting up the estimates relating to hot water, I think it’s easy to use about <span class="red">12 kWh per day per person</span>.</p><h2 id="hot-air--at-home-and-at-work">Hot air – at home and at work</h2><p>Now, does more power go into making hot water and hot food, or into making hot air via our buildings’ radiators?</p><p>One way to estimate the energy used per day for hot air is to imagine a building heated instead by electric fires, whose powers are more familiar to us. The power of a small electric bar fire or electric fan heater is 1 kW (24 kWh per day). In winter, you might need one of these per person to keep toasty. In summer, none. So we estimate that on average one modern person <em>needs</em> to use 12 kWh per day on hot air. But most people use more than they need, keeping several rooms warm simultaneously (kitchen, living room, corridor, and bathroom, say). So a plausible consumption figure for hot air is about double that: <span class="red">24 kWh per day per person</span>.</p><p>This chapter’s companion Chapter E contains a more detailed account of where the heat is going in a building; this model makes it possible to <span id="page52">predict</span> the heat savings from turning the thermostat down, double-glazing the windows, and so forth.</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure58.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 7.7</span>. Hot air total – including domestic and workplace heating – about 24 kWh per day per person.<h3 id="warming-the-outdoors-and-other-luxuries">Warming the outdoors, and other luxuries</h3><p>There’s a growing trend of warming the outdoors with patio heaters. Typical patio heaters have a power of 15 kW. So if you use one of these for a couple of hours every evening, you are using an extra <span class="red">30 kWh per day</span>.</p><p>A more modest luxury is an electric blanket. An electric blanket for a double bed uses 140 W; switching it on for one hour uses <span class="red">0.14 kWh</span>.</p><h2 id="cooling">Cooling</h2><h3 id="fridge-and-freezer">Fridge and freezer</h3><p>We control the temperatures not only of the hot water and hot air with which we surround ourselves, but also of the cold cupboards we squeeze into our hothouses. My fridge-freezer, pictured in figure 7.3, consumes 18 W on average – that’s roughly 0.5 kWh/d.</p><h3 id="air-conditioning">Air-conditioning</h3><p>In countries where the temperature gets above 30 °C, air-conditioning is viewed as a necessity, and the energy cost of delivering that temperature control can be large. However, this part of the book is about British energy consumption, and Britain’s temperatures provide little need for air- conditioning (figure 7.8).</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure59.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 7.8</span>. Cambridge temperature in degrees Celsius, daily (red line), and half-hourly (blue line) during 2006.<p>An economical way to get air-conditioning is an air-source heat pump. A window-mounted electric air-conditioning unit for a single room uses 0.6 kW of electricity and (by heat-exchanger) delivers 2.6 kW of cooling. To estimate how much energy someone might use in the UK, I assumed they might switch such an air-conditioning unit on for about 12 hours per day on 30 days of the year. On the days when it’s on, the air-conditioner uses 7.2 kWh.

Heating and cooling – about 37 units per day per person. I’ve removed the shading from this box to indicate that it represents power that could be delivered by low-grade thermal energy.<h2 id="total-heating-and-cooling">Total heating and cooling</h2><p>Our rough estimate of the total energy that one person might spend on heating and cooling, including home, workplace, and cooking, is <span class="red">37 kWh/d per person</span> (12 for hot water, 24 for hot air, and 1 for cooling).</p><p>Evidence that this estimate is in the right ballpark, or perhaps a little on the low side, comes from my own domestic gas consumption, which for 12 years averaged 40 kWh per day (figure 7.10). At the time I thought I was a fairly frugal user of heating, but I wasn’t being attentive to my actual power consumption. Chapter 21 will reveal how much power I saved once I started paying attention.</p><p>Since heating is a big item in our consumption stack, let’s check my estimates against some national statistics. Nationally, the average <em>domestic</em> consumption for space heating, water, and cooking in the year 2000 was 21 kWh per day per person, and consumption in the <em>service sector</em> for heating, cooling, catering, and hot water was 8.5 kWh/d/p. <sup id="fnref-3"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap07/#fn-3">3</a></sup> For an estimate of workplace heating, let’s take the gas consumption of the University of Cambridge in 2006–7: 16 kWh/d per employee. <sup id="fnref-4"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap07/#fn-4">4</a></sup></p><p>Totting up these three numbers, a second guess for the national spend on heating is 21 + 8.5 + 16 ≈ 45 kWh/d per person, if Cambridge University is a normal workplace.

To obtain the daily figure in table 7.4 I assumed that one person has a load of laundry every three days, and that this sucks valuable heat from the house during the cold half of the year.
