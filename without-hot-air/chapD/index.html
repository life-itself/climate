Slimy underwater plants are no more efficient at photosynthesis than their terrestrial cousins. But there is one trick that I haven‚Äôt discussed, which is standard practice in the algae-to-biodiesel community: they grow their algae in water heavily enriched with carbon dioxide, which might be collected from power stations or other industrial facilities. It takes much less effort for plants to photosynthesize if the carbon dioxide has already been concentrated for them. In a sunny spot in America, in ponds fed with concentrated CO<sub>2</sub> (concentrated to 10%), Ron Putt of Auburn University says that algae can grow at 30 g per square metre per day, producing 0.01 litres of biodiesel per square metre per day. <a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="/without-hot-air/chapD/#chDn07"><span class="darkred">[7]</span></a> This corresponds to a power per unit pond area of <span class="green">4 W/m<sup>2</sup></span> ‚Äì similar to the Bavaria photovoltaic farm. If you wanted to drive a typical car (doing 12 km per litre) a distance of 50 km per day, then you‚Äôd need <span>420 square metres</span> of algae-ponds just to power your car; for comparison, the area of the UK per person is 4000 square metres, of which 69 m<sup>2</sup> is water (figure 6.8). Please don‚Äôt forget that it‚Äôs essential to feed these ponds with concentrated carbon dioxide. So this technology would be limited both by land area ‚Äì how much of the UK we could turn into algal ponds ‚Äì and by the availability of concentrated CO<sub>2</sub>, the capture of which would have an energy cost (a topic discussed in Chapters 23 and 31). Let‚Äôs check the limit imposed by the concentrated CO<sub>2</sub>. To grow 30 g of algae per m<sup>2</sup> per day would require at least 60 g of CO<sub>2</sub> per m<sup>2</sup> per day (because the CO<sub>2</sub> molecule has more mass per carbon atom than the molecules in algae). If all the CO<sub>2</sub> from all UK power stations were captured (roughly 2<sup>1</sup>‚ÅÑ<sub>2</sub> tons per year per person), it could service <span>230 square metres</span> per person of the algal ponds described above ‚Äì roughly 6% of the country. This area would deliver biodiesel with a power of 24 kWh per day per person, assuming that the numbers for sunny America apply here. A plausible vision? Perhaps on one tenth of that scale? I‚Äôll leave it to you to decide.</p><h3 id="what-about-algae-in-the-sea">What about algae in the sea?</h3><p>Remember what I just said: the algae-to-biodiesel posse always feed their algae concentrated CO<sub>2</sub>. If you‚Äôre going out to sea, presumably pumping CO<sub>2</sub> into it won‚Äôt be an option. And without the concentrated CO<sub>2</sub>, the productivity of algae drops 100-fold. For algae in the sea to make a difference, a country-sized harvesting area in the sea would be required.</p><h3 id="what-about-algae-that-produce-hydrogen">What about algae that produce hydrogen?</h3><p>Trying to get slime to produce hydrogen in sunlight is a smart idea because it cuts out a load of chemical steps normally performed by carbohydrate-producing plants. Every chemical step reduces efficiency a little. Hydrogen can be produced directly by the photosynthetic system, right at step one. A research study from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado predicted that a reactor filled with genetically-modified green algae, covering an area of 11 hectares in the Arizona desert, could produce 300 kg of hydrogen per day. <a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="/without-hot-air/chapD/#chDn08"><span class="darkred">[8]</span></a> Hydrogen contains 39 kWh per kg, so this algae-to-hydrogen facility would deliver a power per unit area of 4.4 W/m<sup>2</sup>. Taking into account the estimated electricity required to run the facility, the net power delivered would be reduced to <span class="green">3.6 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>. That strikes me as still quite a promising number ‚Äì compare it with the Bavarian solar photovoltaic farm, for example (<span class="green">5 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>).</p><h2 id="food-for-humans-or-other-animals">Food for humans or other animals</h2><p>Grain crops such as wheat, oats, barley, and corn have an energy density of about 4 kWh per kg. In the UK, wheat yields of 7.7 tons per hectare per year are typical. If the wheat is eaten by an animal, the power per unit area of this process is 0.34 W/m<sup>2</sup>. If 2800 m<sup>2</sup> per person of Britain (that‚Äôs all agricultural land) were devoted to the growth of crops like these, the chemical energy generated would be about <span class="green">24 kWh/d per person</span>.</p><h2 id="incineration-of-agricultural-by-products">Incineration of agricultural by-products</h2><p>We found a moment ago that the power per unit area of a biomass power station burning the best energy crops is 0.2 W/m<sup>2</sup>. If instead we grow crops for food, and put the left-overs that we don‚Äôt eat into a power station ‚Äì or if we feed the food to chickens and put the left-overs that come out of the chickens‚Äô back ends into a power station ‚Äì what power could be delivered per unit area of farmland? Let‚Äôs make a rough guess, then take a look at some real data. For a wild guess, let‚Äôs imagine that by-products are harvested from half of the area of Britain (2000 m<sup>2</sup> per person) and trucked to power stations, and that general agricultural by-products deliver 10% as much power per unit area as the best energy crops: 0.02 W/m<sup>2</sup>. Multiplying this by 2000 m<sup>2</sup> we get <span class="green">1 kWh per day per person</span>.</p><p>Have I been unfair to agricultural garbage in making this wild guess? We can re-estimate the plausible production from agricultural left-overs by scaling up the prototype straw-burning power station at Elean in East Anglia. <a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="/without-hot-air/chapD/#chDn09"><span class="darkred">[9]</span></a> Elean‚Äôs power output is 36 MW, and it uses 200 000 tons per year from land located within a 50-mile radius. If we assume this density can be replicated across the whole country, the Elean model offers 0.002 W/m<sup>2</sup>. At 4000 m<sup>2</sup> per person, that‚Äôs 8 W per person, or <span class="green">0.2 kWh/day per person</span>.</p><p>Let‚Äôs calculate this another way. UK straw production is 10 million tons per year, or 0.46 kg per day per person. At 4.2 kWh per kg, this straw has a chemical energy of 2 kWh per day per person. If all the straw were burned in 30%-efficient power stations ‚Äì a proposal that wouldn‚Äôt go down well with farm animals, who have other uses for straw ‚Äì the electricity generated would be <span class="green">0.6 kWh/d per person</span>.</p><h3 id="landfill-methane-gas">Landfill methane gas</h3><p>At present, much of the methane gas leaking out of rubbish tips comes from biological materials, especially waste food. So, as long as we keep throwing away things like food and newspapers, landfill gas is a sustainable energy source ‚Äì plus, burning that methane might be a good idea from a climate-change perspective, since methane is a stronger greenhouse-gas than CO<sub>2</sub>. A landfill site receiving 7.5 million tons of household waste per year can generate 50 000 m<sup>3</sup> per hour of methane.</p><p>In 1994, landfill methane emissions were estimated to be 0.05 m<sup>3</sup> per person per day, which has a chemical energy of 0.5 kWh/d per person, and would generate <span class="green">0.2 kWh(e)/d per person</span>, if it were all converted to electricity with 40% efficiency. Landfill gas emissions are declining because of changes in legislation, and are now roughly 50% lower. <a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="/without-hot-air/chapD/#chDn10"><span class="darkred">[10]</span></a></p><h3 id="burning-household-waste">Burning household waste</h3><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure285.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure D.4.</span> SELCHP ‚Äì your trash is their business.<span id="SELCHP">SELCHP</span> (&quot;South East London Combined Heat and Power&quot;) [[<span class="websitetitle">www.selchp. com</span>](http://www.selchp.com/)] is a 35 MW power station that is paid to burn 420 kt per year of blackbag waste from the London area. They burn the waste as a whole, without sorting. After burning, ferrous metals are removed for recycling, hazardous wastes are filtered out and sent to a special landfill site, and the remaining ash is sent for reprocessing into recycled material for road building or construction use. The calorific value of the waste is 2.5 kWh/kg, and the thermal efficiency of the power station is about 21%, so each 1 kg of waste gets turned into 0.5 kWh of electricity. The carbon emissions are about 1000 g CO<sub>2</sub> per kWh.
