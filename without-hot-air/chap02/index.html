balance sheet</h1><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure324.gif"/></p><blockquote><p><em>Nature cannot be fooled</em></p><p>Richard Feynman</p></blockquote><p>Let‚Äôs talk about energy consumption and energy production. At the moment, most of the energy the developed world consumes is produced from fossil fuels; that‚Äôs not sustainable. Exactly how long we could keep living on fossil fuels is an interesting question, but it‚Äôs not the question we‚Äôll address in this book. I want to think about <em>living without fossil fuels</em>.</p><p>We‚Äôre going to make two stacks. In the left-hand, red stack we will add up our energy consumption, and in the right-hand, green stack, we‚Äôll add up sustainable energy production. We‚Äôll assemble the two stacks gradually, adding items one at a time as we discuss them.</p><p>The question addressed in this book is ‚Äúcan we <em>conceivably</em> live sustainably?‚Äù So, we will add up all <em>conceivable</em> sustainable energy sources and put them in the right-hand, green stack.</p><p>In the left-hand, red stack, we‚Äôll estimate the consumption of a <span id="p22"></span>‚Äútypical moderately-afÔ¨Çuent person;‚Äù I encourage you to tot up an estimate of your <em>own</em> consumption, creating your own personalized left-hand stack too. Later on we‚Äôll also Ô¨Ånd out the current <em>average</em> energy consumption of Europeans and Americans.</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure325.gif"/></p><span id="page23">As we estimate</span> our consumption of energy for heating, transportation, manufacturing, and so forth, the aim is not only to compute a number for the left-hand stack of our balance sheet, but also to understand what each number depends on, and how susceptible to modiÔ¨Åcation it is.<p>In the right-hand, green stack, we‚Äôll add up the sustainable production estimates for the United Kingdom. This will allow us to answer the question ‚Äúcan the UK conceivably live on its own renewables?‚Äù</p><p>Whether the sustainable energy sources that we put in the right-hand stack are <em>economically</em> feasible is an important question, but let‚Äôs leave that question to one side, and just add up the two stacks Ô¨Årst. Sometimes people focus too much on economic feasibility and they miss the big picture. For example, people discuss ‚Äúis wind cheaper than nuclear?‚Äù and forget to ask ‚Äúhow <em>much</em> wind is available?‚Äù or ‚Äúhow much uranium is left?‚Äù</p><p>The outcome when we add everything up might look like this:</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure326.gif"/></p><p>If we Ô¨Ånd consumption is much less than conceivable sustainable production, then we can say ‚Äúgood, <em>maybe</em> we can live sustainably; let‚Äôs look into the economic, social, and environmental costs of the sustainable alternatives, and Ô¨Ågure out which of them deserve the most research and development; if we do a good job, there <em>might</em> not be an energy crisis.‚Äù</p><p>On the other hand, the outcome of our sums might look like this:</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure327.gif"/></p><p>‚Äì a much bleaker picture. This picture says ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt matter what the <span id="page24">economics</span> of sustainable power are: there‚Äôs simply <em>not enough</em> sustainable power to support our current lifestyle; massive change is coming.‚Äù</p><h2 id="energy-and-power">Energy and power</h2><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure18.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 2.1</span>. Distinguishing energy and power. Each of these 60W light bulbs has a <span>power</span> of 60W when switched on; it doesn‚Äôt have an &quot;energy&quot; of 60W. The bulb uses 60W of electrical <span>power</span> when it‚Äôs on; it emits 60 W of <span>power</span> in the form of light and heat (mainly the latter).<p>Most discussions of energy consumption and production are confusing because of the proliferation of <em>units</em> in which energy and power are measured, from ‚Äútons of oil equivalent‚Äù to ‚Äúterawatt-hours‚Äù (TWh) and ‚Äúexajoules‚Äù (EJ). Nobody but a specialist has a feeling for what ‚Äúa barrel of oil‚Äù or ‚Äúa million BTUs‚Äù means in human terms. In this book, we‚Äôll express everything in a single set of personal units that everyone can relate to.</p><p>The unit of <strong>energy</strong> I have chosen is the kilowatt-hour (kWh). This quantity is called ‚Äúone unit‚Äù on electricity bills, and it costs a domestic user about 10p in the UK in 2008. As we‚Äôll see, most individual daily choices involve amounts of energy equal to small numbers of kilowatt-hours.</p><p>When we discuss <strong>powers</strong> (rates at which we use or produce energy), the main unit will be the kilowatt-hour per day (kWh/d). We‚Äôll also occasionally use the watt (40 W ‚âà 1kWh/d) and the kilowatt (1 kW = 1000 W = 24 kWh/d), as I‚Äôll explain below. The kilowatt-hour per day is a nice human-sized unit: most personal energy-guzzling activities guzzle at a rate of a small number of kilowatt-hours per day. For example, one 40 W lightbulb, kept switched on all the time, uses <strong>one</strong> kilowatt-hour per day. Some electricity companies include graphs in their electricity bills, showing energy consumption in kilowatt-hours per day. I‚Äôll use the same unit for all forms of power, not just electricity. Petrol consumption, gas consumption, coal consumption: I‚Äôll measure all these powers in kilowatthours per day. Let me make this clear: for some people, the word ‚Äúpower‚Äù means only <em>electrical</em> energy consumption. But this book concerns <em>all</em> forms of energy consumption and production, and I will use the word ‚Äúpower‚Äù for all of them.</p><p>One kilowatt-hour per day is roughly the power you could get from one human servant. The number of kilowatt-hours per day you use is thus the effective number of servants you have working for you.</p><span class="darkblue">volume</span>is measured in<span class="darkblue">litres</span><span class="mauve">Ô¨Çow</span> is measured in<span class="mauve">litres per minute</span><span class="darkblue">energy</span> is measured in<span class="darkblue">kWh</span><span class="mauve">power</span> is measured in<span class="mauve">kWh per day</span><p>People use the two terms energy and power interchangeably in ordinary speech, but in this book we must stick rigorously to their scientiÔ¨Åc deÔ¨Ånitions. <em>Power is the rate at which something uses energy</em>.</p><p>Maybe a good way to explain <span class="darkblue">energy</span> and <span class="mauve">power</span> is by an analogy with <span class="darkblue">water</span> and <span class="mauve">water-Ô¨Çow</span> from taps. If you want a drink of water, you want a <em>volume</em> of water ‚Äì one litre, perhaps (if you‚Äôre thirsty). When you turn on a tap, you create a <em><span class="mauve">Ô¨Çow</span></em> of water ‚Äì <span class="mauve">one litre per minute</span>, say, if the tap yields only a trickle; or 10 litres per minute, from a more generous tap. You can get the same <span class="darkblue">volume</span> (one litre) either by running the trickling tap for one minute, or by running the generous tap for one tenth of a minute. The <em><span class="darkblue">volume</span></em> delivered in a particular time is equal to the <em><span class="mauve">Ô¨Çow</span></em> multiplied by the <em><span class="red">time:</span></em></p><span class="darkblue">volume</span> = <span class="mauve">Ô¨Çow</span> √ó <span class="red">time.</span><p>We say that a <em>Ô¨Çow</em> is a <em>rate</em> at which <em>volume</em> is delivered. If you know the volume delivered in a particular time, you get the Ô¨Çow by dividing the volume by the time:</p><span class="mauve">Ô¨Çow</span> = <span class="darkblue">volume</span> / <span class="red">time.</span><span class="darkblue">energy</span>is measured in<span class="darkblue">kWh</span> or <span class="darkblue">MJ</span><span class="mauve">power</span>is measured in<span class="mauve">kWh per day</span>or <span class="mauve">kW</span>or <span class="mauve">W</span> (watts) or <span class="mauve">MW</span> (megawatts) or <span class="mauve">GW</span> (gigawatts) or <span class="mauve">TW</span> (terawatts)<p>Here‚Äôs the connection to energy and power. <em><span class="darkblue">Energy</span></em> is like water <em><span class="darkblue">volume</span></em>: <em><span class="mauve">power</span></em> is like water <em><span class="mauve">Ô¨Çow</span></em>. For example, whenever a toaster is switched on, it starts to consume <em><span class="mauve">power</span></em> at a rate of one kilowatt. It continues to consume one kilowatt until it is switched off. To put it another way, the toaster (if it‚Äôs left on permanently) consumes one kilowatt-hour (kWh) of energy per hour; it also consumes 24 kilowatt-hours per day.</p><p>The longer the toaster is on, the more <span class="darkblue">energy</span> it uses. You can work out the energy used by a particular activity by multiplying the power by the duration:</p><span class="darkblue">energy</span>= <span class="mauve">power</span> √ó <span class="red">time</span>.<p>The joule is the standard international unit of energy, but sadly it‚Äôs far too small to work with. The kilowatt-hour is equal to 3.6 million joules (3.6 megajoules).</p><p>Powers are so useful and important, they have something that water Ô¨Çows don‚Äôt have: they have their own special units. When we talk of a Ô¨Çow, we might measure it in ‚Äúlitres per minute,‚Äù ‚Äúgallons per hour,‚Äù or ‚Äúcubic-metres per second;‚Äù these units‚Äô names make clear that the Ô¨Çow is ‚Äúa volume per unit time.‚Äù A power of <em>one joule per second</em> is called <em>one watt</em>. 1000 joules per second is called one kilowatt. Let‚Äôs get the terminology straight: the toaster uses one kilowatt. It doesn‚Äôt use ‚Äúone kilowatt per second.‚Äù The ‚Äúper second‚Äù is already built in to the deÔ¨Ånition of the kilowatt: one kilowatt means ‚Äúone kilojoule per second.‚Äù <sup id="fnref-1"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap02/#fn-1">1</a></sup> Similarly we say ‚Äúa nuclear power station generates one gigawatt.‚Äù One gigawatt, by the way, is one billion watts, one million kilowatts, or 1000 megawatts. So one gigawatt is a million toasters. And the ‚Äúg‚Äùs in gigawatt are pronounced hard, the same as in ‚Äúgiggle.‚Äù And, while I‚Äôm tapping the blackboard, we capitalize the ‚Äúg‚Äù and ‚Äúw‚Äù in ‚Äúgigawatt‚Äù only when we write the abbreviation ‚ÄúGW.‚Äù</p><p>Please, never, ever say ‚Äúone kilowatt per second,‚Äù <sup id="fnref-2"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap02/#fn-2">2</a></sup> ‚Äúone kilowatt per hour,‚Äù or ‚Äúone kilowatt per day;‚Äù none of these is a valid measure of power. The urge that people have to say ‚Äúper something‚Äù when talking about their toasters is one of the reasons I decided to use the ‚Äúkilowatt-hour per day‚Äù as my unit of power. I‚Äôm sorry that it‚Äôs a bit cumbersome to say and to write.</p><p>1TWh (one terawatt-hour) is equal to one billion kWh.</p><span id="page26">Here‚Äôs</span> one last thing to make clear: if I say &quot;someone used a gigawatthour of energy,&quot; I am simply telling you *how much* energy they used, not *how fast* they used it. Talking about a gigawatt-hour *doesn‚Äôt* imply the energy was used *in one hour*. You could use a gigawatt-hour of energy by switching on one million toasters for one hour, or by switching on 1000 toasters for 1000 hours.<p>As I said, I‚Äôll usually quote powers in kWh/d <em>per person</em>. One reason for liking these personal units is that it makes it much easier to move from talking about the UK to talking about other countries or regions. For example, imagine we are discussing waste incineration and we learn that UK waste incineration delivers a power of 7 TWh per year and that Denmark‚Äôs waste incineration delivers 10 TWh per year. Does this help us say whether Denmark incinerates ‚Äúmore‚Äù waste than the UK? While the total power produced from waste in each country may be interesting, I think that what we usually want to know is the waste incineration <em>per person</em>. (For the record, that is: Denmark, 5 kWh/d per person; UK, 0.3 kWh/d per person. So Danes incinerate about 13 times as much waste as Brits.) To save ink, I‚Äôll sometimes abbreviate ‚Äúper person‚Äù to ‚Äú/p‚Äù. By discussing everything per-person from the outset, we end up with a more transportable book, one that will hopefully be useful for sustainable energy discussions worldwide.</p><h2 id="picky-details">Picky details</h2><h4 id="isnt-energy-conserved-we-talk-about-using-energy-but-doesnt-one-of-the-laws-of-nature-say-that-energy-cant-be-created-or-destroyed">Isn‚Äôt energy conserved? We talk about ‚Äúusing‚Äù energy, but doesn‚Äôt one of the laws of nature say that energy can‚Äôt be created or destroyed?</h4><p>Yes, I‚Äôm being imprecise. This is really a book about <em>entropy</em> ‚Äì a trickier thing to explain. When we ‚Äúuse up‚Äù one kilojoule of energy, what we‚Äôre really doing is taking one kilojoule of energy in a form that has <em>low entropy</em> (for example, electricity), and <em>converting</em> it into an exactly equal amount of energy in another form, usually one that has much higher entropy (for example, hot air or hot water). When we‚Äôve ‚Äúused‚Äù the energy, it‚Äôs still there; but we normally can‚Äôt ‚Äúuse‚Äù the energy over and over again, because only <em>low entropy</em> energy is ‚Äúuseful‚Äù to us. Sometimes these different grades of energy are distinguished by adding a label to the units: one kWh(e) is one kilowatt-hour of electrical energy ‚Äì the highest grade of energy. One kWh(th) is one kilowatt-hour of thermal energy ‚Äì for example the energy in ten litres of boiling-hot water. Energy lurking in higher-temperature things is more useful (lower entropy) than energy in tepid things. A third grade of energy is chemical energy. Chemical energy is high-grade energy like electricity.</p><p>It‚Äôs a convenient but sloppy shorthand to talk about the energy rather than the entropy, and that is what we‚Äôll do most of the time in this book. Occasionally, we‚Äôll have to smarten up this sloppiness; for example, when we discuss refrigeration, power stations, heat pumps, or geothermal power.</p><h4 id="are-you-comparing-apples-and-oranges-is-it-valid-to-compare-different-forms-of-energy-such-as-the-chemical-energy-that-is-fed-into-a-petrolpowered-car-and-the-electricity-from-a-wind-turbine">Are you comparing apples and oranges? Is it valid to compare different forms of energy such as the chemical energy that is fed into a petrolpowered car and the electricity from a wind turbine?</h4><p>By comparing consumed energy with conceivable produced energy, I do not wish to imply that all forms of energy are equivalent and interchangeable. The electrical energy produced by a wind turbine is of no use to a petrol engine; and petrol is no use if you want to power a television. In principle, energy can be converted from one form to another, though conversion entails losses. Fossil-fuel power stations, for example, guzzle <em>chemical energy</em> and produce <em>electricity</em> (with an efÔ¨Åciency of 40% or so). And aluminium plants guzzle <em>electrical energy</em> to create a product with high <em>chemical energy</em> ‚Äì aluminium (with an efÔ¨Åciency of 30% or so).</p><p>In some summaries of energy production and consumption, all the different forms of energy are put into the same units, but multipliers are introduced, rating electrical energy from hydroelectricity for example as being worth 2.5 times more than the chemical energy in oil. This bumping up of electricity‚Äôs effective energy value can be justiÔ¨Åed by saying, ‚Äúwell, 1 kWh of electricity is equivalent to 2.5 kWh of oil, because if we put that much oil into a standard power station it would deliver 40% of 2.5 kWh, which is 1 kWh of electricity.‚Äù In this book, however, I will usually use a one-to-one conversion rate when comparing different forms of energy. It is <em>not</em> the case that 2.5 kWh of oil is inescapably equivalent to 1 kWh of electricity; that just happens to be the perceived exchange rate in a worldview where oil is used to make electricity. Yes, conversion of chemical energy to electrical energy is done with this particular inefÔ¨Åcient exchange rate. But electrical energy can also be converted to chemical energy. In an alternative world (perhaps not far-off) with relatively plentiful electricity and little oil, we might use electricity to make liquid fuels; in that world we would surely not use the same exchange rate ‚Äì each kWh of gasoline would then cost us something like 3 kWh of electricity<!-- -->!<!-- --> I think the timeless and scientiÔ¨Åc way to summarize and compare energies is to hold 1 kWh of chemical energy equivalent to 1 kWh of electricity. My choice to use this one-to-one conversion rate means that some of my sums will look a bit different from other people‚Äôs. (For example, BP‚Äôs <em>Statistical Review of World Energy</em> rates 1 kWh of electricity as equivalent to 100/38 ‚âà 2.6 kWh of oil; on the other hand, the government‚Äôs <em>Digest of <span id="DUKES">UK Energy</span> Statistics</em> uses the same one-to-one conversion rate as me.) And I emphasize again, this choice does not imply that I‚Äôm suggesting you could convert either form of energy directly into the other. Converting chemical energy into electrical energy always wastes energy, and so does converting electrical into chemical energy.</p><h2 id="physics-and-equations">Physics and equations</h2><p>Throughout the book, my aim is not only to work out numbers indicating our current energy consumption and conceivable sustainable <span id="page28">production</span>,but also to make clear <em>what these numbers depend on</em>. Understanding what the numbers depend on is essential if we are to choose sensible policies to change any of the numbers. Only if we understand the physics behind energy consumption and energy production can we assess assertions such as ‚Äúcars waste 99% of the energy they consume; we could redesign cars so that they use 100 times less energy.‚Äù Is this assertion true? To explain the answer, I will need to use equations like</p><p>kinetic energy = ¬Ω<em>mv</em><sup>2</sup></p><p>However, I recognize that to many readers, such formulae are a foreign language. So, here‚Äôs my promise: <em>I‚Äôll keep all this foreign-language stuff in technical chapters at the end of the book</em>. Any reader with a high-school/secondaryschool qualiÔ¨Åcation in maths, physics, or chemistry should enjoy these technical chapters. The main thread of the book (from <a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="../Text/chap01.xhtml">chapter 1</a> to <a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="../Text/chap32.xhtml">chapter 32</a>) is intended to be accessible to everyone who can add, multiply, and divide. It is especially aimed at our dear elected and unelected representatives, the Members of Parliament.</p><p>One last point, before we get rolling: I don‚Äôt know everything about energy. I don‚Äôt have all the answers, and the numbers I offer are open to revision and correction. (Indeed I expect corrections and will publish them on the book‚Äôs website.)

Understanding what the numbers depend on is essential if we are to choose sensible policies to change any of the numbers.
