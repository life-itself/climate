Electricity generated per capita from nuclear fission in 2007, in kWh per day per person, in each of the countries with nuclear power. [^1]<h1 id="24-nuclear">24 Nuclear?</h1><blockquote><p><em>We made the mistake of lumping nuclear energy in with nuclear weapons, as if all things nuclear were evil. I think that‚Äôs as big a mistake as if you lumped nuclear medicine in with nuclear weapons.</em></p><p>Patrick Moore, former Director of Greenpeace International</p></blockquote><p>Nuclear power comes in two flavours. Nuclear <em>fission</em> is the flavour that we know how to use in power stations; fission uses uranium, an exceptionally heavy element, as fuel. Nuclear <em>fusion</em> is the flavour that we don‚Äôt yet know how to implement in power stations; fusion would use light elements, especially hydrogen, as its fuel. Fission reactions split up heavy nuclei into medium-sized nuclei, releasing energy. Fusion reactions fuse light nuclei into medium-sized nuclei, releasing energy.</p><p>Both forms of nuclear power, fission and fusion, have an important property: the nuclear energy available per atom is roughly one million times bigger than the chemical energy per atom of typical fuels. This means that the amounts of fuel and waste that must be dealt with at a nuclear reactor can be up to one million times smaller than the amounts of fuel and waste at an equivalent fossil-fuel power station.</p><p>Let‚Äôs try to personalize these ideas. The mass of the fossil fuels consumed by ‚Äúthe average British person‚Äù is about 16 kg per day (4 kg of coal, 4 kg of oil, and 8 kg of gas). That means that every single day, an amount of fossil fuels with the same weight as 28 pints of milk is extracted from a hole in the ground, transported, processed, and burned somewhere on your behalf. The average Brit‚Äôs fossil fuel habit creates 11 tons per year of waste carbon dioxide; that‚Äôs 30 kg per day. In the previous chapter we raised the idea of capturing waste carbon dioxide, compressing it into solid or liquid form, and transporting it somewhere for disposal. Imagine that one person was responsible for capturing and dealing with all their own carbon dioxide waste. 30 kg per day of carbon dioxide is a substantial rucksack-full every day ‚Äì the same weight as 53 pints of milk<!-- -->!</p><p>In contrast, the amount of natural uranium required to provide the same amount of energy as 16 kg of fossil fuels, in a standard fission reactor, is 2 grams; and the resulting waste weighs one quarter of a gram. (This 2 g of uranium is not as small as one millionth of 16 kg per day, by the way, because today‚Äôs reactors burn up less than 1% of the uranium.) To deliver 2 grams of uranium per day, the miners at the uranium mine would have to deal with perhaps 200 g of ore per day.</p><p>So the material streams flowing into and out of nuclear reactors are small, relative to fossil-fuel streams. ‚ÄúSmall is beautiful,‚Äù but the fact that the nuclear waste stream is small doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs not a problem; it‚Äôs just a ‚Äúbeautifully small‚Äù problem.</p><h2 id="sustainable-power-from-nuclear-fission">‚ÄúSustainable‚Äù power from nuclear fission</h2><p>Figure 24.1 shows how much electricity was generated globally by nuclear power in 2007, broken down by country.</p><p>million tons uranium</p><p>Australia</p><p>1.14</p><p>Kazakhstan</p><p>0.82</p><p>Canada</p><p>0.44</p><p>USA</p><p>0.34</p><p>South Africa</p><p>0.34</p><p>Namibia</p><p>0.28</p><p>Brazil</p><p>0.28</p><p>Russian Federation</p><p>0.17</p><p>Uzbekistan</p><p>0.12</p><p>World total (conventional reserves in the ground)</p><p>4.7</p><p>Phosphate deposits</p><p>22</p><p>Seawater</p><p>4500</p><span class="figurenumber">Table 24.2</span>.

There‚Äôs also 1.3 million tons of depleted uranium sitting around in stockpiles, a by-product of previous uranium activities.<p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure194.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 24.3</span>. Workers push uranium slugs into the X-10 Graphite Reactor.<p>Could nuclear power be ‚Äúsustainable‚Äù? Leaving aside for a moment the usual questions about safety and waste-disposal, a key question is whether humanity could live for generations on fission. How great are the world wide supplies of uranium, and other fissionable fuels? Do we have only a few decades‚Äô worth of uranium, or do we have enough for millennia?</p><p>To estimate a ‚Äúsustainable‚Äù power from uranium, I took the total recoverable uranium in the ground and in seawater, divided it fairly between 6 billion humans, and asked ‚Äúhow fast can we use this if it has to last 1000 years?‚Äù</p><p>Almost all the recoverable uranium is in the oceans, not in the ground: seawater contains 3.3 mg of uranium per m<sup>3</sup> of water, which adds up to 4.5 billion tons worldwide. I called the uranium in the ocean ‚Äúrecoverable‚Äù but this is a bit inaccurate ‚Äì most ocean waters are quite inaccessible, and the ocean conveyor belt rolls round only once every 1000 years or so; and no-one has yet demonstrated uranium-extraction from seawater on an in dustrial scale. So we‚Äôll make separate estimates for two cases: first using only mined uranium, and second using ocean uranium too.</p><p>The uranium ore in the ground that‚Äôs extractable at prices below $130 per kg of uranium is about one thousandth of this. If prices went above $130 per kg, phosphate deposits that contain uranium at low concentrations would become economic to mine. Recovery of uranium from phosphates is perfectly possible, and was done in America and Belgium before 1998. For the estimate of mined uranium, I‚Äôll add both the conventional uranium ore and the phosphates, to give a total resource of 27 million tons of uranium (table 24.2).</p><p>We‚Äôll consider two ways to use uranium in a reactor: (a) the widely-used <em>once-through method</em> gets energy mainly from the <sup>235</sup>U (which makes up just 0.7% of uranium), and discards the remaining <sup>238</sup>U; (b) <em>fast breeder reactors</em>, which are more expensive to build, convert the <sup>238</sup>U to fissionable plutonium-239 and obtain roughly 60 times as much energy from the uranium. <sup id="fnref-2"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap24/#fn-2">2</a></sup></p><h3 id="once-through-reactors-using-uranium-from-the-ground">Once-through reactors, using uranium from the ground</h3><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure195.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 24.4</span>.

This sustainable rate is the output of just 136 nuclear power stations, and is half of today‚Äôs nuclear power production. It‚Äôs very possible this is an underestimate of uranium‚Äôs potential, since, as there is not yet a uranium shortage, there is no incentive for exploration and little uranium exploration has been undertaken since the 1980s; so maybe more mineable uranium will be discovered. Indeed, one paper published in 1980 estimated that the low-grade uranium resource is more than 1000 times greater than the 27 million tons we just assumed. <sup id="fnref-4"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap24/#fn-4">4</a></sup></p><p>Could our current once-through use of mined uranium be sustainable? It‚Äôs hard to say, since there is such uncertainty about the result of future exploration. Certainly at today‚Äôs rate of consumption, once-through reactors could keep going for hundreds of years. But if we wanted to crank up nuclear power 40-fold worldwide, in order to get off fossil fuels and to allow standards of living to rise, we might worry that once-through reactors are not a sustainable technology.</p><h3 id="fast-breeder-reactors-using-uranium-from-the-ground">Fast breeder reactors, using uranium from the ground</h3><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure196.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 24.5</span>. Dounreay Nuclear Power Development Establishment, whose primary purpose was the development of fast breeder reactor technology. Photo by John Mullen.<p>Uranium can be used 60 times more efficiently in fast breeder reactors, which burn up all the uranium ‚Äì both the <sup>238</sup>U and the <sup>235</sup>U (in contrast to the once-through reactors, which burn mainly <sup>235</sup>U). As long as we don‚Äôt chuck away the spent fuel that is spat out by once-through reactors, this source of depleted uranium could be used too, so uranium that is put in once-through reactors need not be wasted. If we used all the mineable uranium (plus the depleted uranium stockpiles) in 60-times-more-efficient fast breeder reactors, the power would be <span class="green">33 kWh per day per person</span>. Attitudes to fast breeder reactors range from ‚Äúthis is a dangerous failed experimental technology whereof one should not speak‚Äù to ‚Äúwe can and should start building breeder reactors right away.‚Äù I am not competent to comment on the risks of breeder technology, and I don‚Äôt want to mix ethical assertions with factual assertions. My aim is just to help understand the numbers. The one ethical position I wish to push is ‚Äúwe should have a plan that adds up.‚Äù</p><h3 id="once-through-using-uranium-from-the-oceans">Once-through, using uranium from the oceans</h3><p>The oceans‚Äô uranium, if completely extracted and used in once-through reactors, corresponds to a total energy of</p><p>[\begin{matrix}

The oceans circulate slowly: half of the water is in the Pacific Ocean, and deep Pacific waters circulate to the surface on the great ocean conveyor only every 1600 years. Let‚Äôs imagine that 10% of the uranium is extracted over such a 1600-year period. That‚Äôs an extraction rate of 280 000 tons per year.

(There‚Äôs currently 369 GW of nuclear reactors, so this figure corresponds to a 4-fold increase in nuclear power over today‚Äôs levels.) I conclude that ocean extraction of uranium would turn today‚Äôs once-through reactors into a ‚Äúsustainable‚Äù option ‚Äì assuming that the uranium reactors can cover the energy cost of the ocean extraction process.</p><h3 id="fast-breeder-reactors-using-uranium-from-the-oceans">Fast breeder reactors, using uranium from the oceans</h3><p>If fast reactors are 60 times more efficient, the same extraction of ocean uranium could deliver <span class="green">420 kWh per day per person</span>.

The fast breeder reactors would deliver <span class="green">5 kWh per day per person</span>.</p><p>All these numbers are summarized in figure 24.6.</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure193.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 24.6</span>. &quot;Sustainable&quot; power from uranium. For comparison, world nuclear power production today is 1.2 kWh/d per person. British nuclear power production used to be 4 kWh/d per person and is declining.<h3 id="what-about-costs">What about costs?</h3><p>As usual in this book, my main calculations have paid little attention to economics. However, since the potential contribution of ocean-uranium-based power is one of the biggest in our ‚Äúsustainable‚Äù production list, it seems appropriate to discuss whether this uranium-power figure is at all economically plausible.</p><p>Japanese researchers have found a technique for extracting uranium from seawater <sup id="fnref-5"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap24/#fn-5">5</a></sup> at a cost of $100‚Äì300 per kilogram of uranium, in comparison with a current cost of about $20/kg for uranium from ore. Because uranium contains so much more energy per ton than traditional fuels, this 5-fold or 15-fold increase in the cost of uranium would have little effect on the cost of nuclear power: nuclear power‚Äôs price is dominated by the cost of power-station construction and decommissioning, not by the cost of the fuel. Even a price of $300/kg would increase the cost of nuclear energy by only about 0.3 p per kWh. The expense of uranium extraction could be reduced by combining it with another use of seawater ‚Äì for example, power-station cooling. <sup id="fnref-6"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap24/#fn-6">6</a></sup></p><p>We‚Äôre not home yet: does the Japanese technique scale up? What is the energy cost of processing all the seawater? In the Japanese experiment, three cages full of adsorbent uranium-attracting material weighing 350 kg collected ‚Äúmore than 1 kg of yellow cake in 240 days;‚Äù this figure corresponds to about 1.6 kg per year. The cages had a cross-sectional area of 48 m<sup>2</sup>. To power a once-through 1 GW nuclear power station, we need 160 000 kg per year, which is a production rate 100 000 times greater than the Japanese experiment‚Äôs. If we simply scaled up the Japanese technique, which accumulated uranium passively from the sea, a power of 1 GW would thus need cages having a collecting area of 4.8 km<sup>2</sup> and containing a weight of 350 000 tons of adsorbent material ‚Äì more than the weight of the steel in the reactor itself. To put these large numbers in human terms, if uranium were delivering, say, 22 kWh per day per person, each 1 GW reactor would be shared between 1 million people, each of whom needs 0.16 kg of uranium per year. So each person would require one tenth of the Japanese experimental facility, with a weight of 35 kg per person, and an area of <span class="darkblue">5 m<sup>2</sup></span> per person. The proposal that such uranium-extraction facilities should be created is thus similar in scale to proposals such as ‚Äúevery person should have <span class="darkblue">10 m<sup>2</sup></span> of solar panels‚Äù and ‚Äúevery person should have a one-ton car and a dedicated parking place for it.‚Äù A large investment, yes, but not absurdly off scale. And that was the calculation for once-through reactors. For fast breeder reactors, 60 times less uranium is required, so the mass per person of the uranium collector would be 0.5 kg.</p><h2 id="thorium">Thorium</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Country</th><th>Reserves (1000 tons)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Turkey</td><td>380</td></tr><tr><td>Australia</td><td>300</td></tr><tr><td>India</td><td>290</td></tr><tr><td>Norway</td><td>170</td></tr><tr><td>USA</td><td>160</td></tr><tr><td>Canada</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>South Africa</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>Brazil</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Other countries</td><td>95</td></tr><tr><td>World total</td><td>1580</td></tr></tbody></table><span class="figurenumber">Table 24.7</span>. Known world thorium resources in monazite (economically extractable). [^7]<p>Thorium is a radioactive element similar to uranium. Formerly used to make gas mantles, it is about three times as abundant in the earth‚Äôs crust as uranium. Soil commonly contains around 6 parts per million of thorium, and some minerals contain 12% thorium oxide. Seawater contains little thorium, because thorium oxide is insoluble. Thorium can be completely burned up in simple reactors (in contrast to standard uranium reactors which use only about 1% of natural uranium). Thorium is used in nuclear reactors in India. If uranium ore runs low, thorium will probably become the dominant nuclear fuel.</p><p>Thorium reactors deliver 3.6 billion kWh of heat per ton of thorium, <sup id="fnref-8"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap24/#fn-8">8</a></sup> which implies that a 1 GW reactor requires about 6 tons of thorium per year, assuming its generators are 40% efficient. Worldwide thorium resources are estimated to total about 6 million tons, four times more than the known reserves shown in table 24.7. As with the uranium resources, it seems plausible that these thorium resources are an underestimate, since thorium prospecting is not highly valued today. If we assume, as with uranium, that these resources are used up over 1000 years and shared equally among 6 billion people, we find that the ‚Äúsustainable‚Äù power thus generated is <span class="green">4 kWh/d per person</span>.</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure197.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 24.8</span>.

Assuming conversion to electricity at 40% efficiency, this would deliver <span class="green">24 kWh/d per person</span> for 1000 years. And the waste from the energy amplifier would be much less radioactive too. They argue that, in due course, many times more thorium would be economically extractable than the current 6 million tons. If their suggestion ‚Äì 300 times more ‚Äì is correct, then thorium and the energy amplifier could offer 120 kWh/d per person for 60 000 years.</p><h2 id="land-use">Land use</h2><p>Let‚Äôs imagine that Britain decides it is serious about getting off fossil fuels, and creates a lot of new nuclear reactors, even though this may not be ‚Äúsustainable.‚Äù If we build enough reactors to make possible a significant decarbonization of transport and heating, can we fit the required nuclear reactors into Britain? The number we need to know is the power per unit area of nuclear power stations, which is about <span class="green">1000W/m<sup>2</sup></span> (figure 24.10). Let‚Äôs imagine generating 22 kWh per day per person of nuclear power ‚Äì equivalent to 55 GW (roughly the same as France‚Äôs nuclear power), which could be delivered by 55 nuclear power stations, each occupying one square kilometre.

It‚Äôs just dangerous, <sup id="fnref-13"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap24/#fn-13">13</a></sup> much as coal mines, petrol repositories, fossil-fuel burning and wind turbines are dangerous. Even if we have no guarantee against nuclear accidents in the future, I think the right way to assess nuclear is to compare it objectively with other sources of power. Coal power stations, for example, expose the public to nuclear radiation, because coal ash typically contains uranium. Indeed, according to a paper published in the journal <em>Science</em>, people in America living near coal-fired power stations are exposed to higher radiation doses than those living near nuclear power plants. <sup id="fnref-14"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap24/#fn-14">14</a></sup></p><p>When quantifying the public risks of different power sources, we need a new unit. I‚Äôll go with ‚Äúdeaths per GWy (gigawatt-year).‚Äù Let me try to convey what it would mean if a power source had a death rate of 1 death per GWy. One gigawatt-year is the energy produced by a 1 GW power station, if it operates flat-out for one year. Britain‚Äôs electricity consumption is roughly 45 GW, or, if you like, 45 gigawatt-years per year. So if we got our electricity from sources with a death rate of 1 death per GWy, that would mean the British electricity supply system was killing 45 people per year. For comparison, 3000 people die per year on Britain‚Äôs roads. So, if you are <em>not</em> campaigning for the abolition of roads, you may deduce that ‚Äú1 death per GWy‚Äù is a death rate that, while sad, you might be content to live with. Obviously, 0.1 deaths per GWy would be preferable, but it takes only a moment‚Äôs reflection to realize that, sadly, fossil-fuel energy production must have a cost greater than 0.1 deaths per GWy ‚Äì just think of disasters on oil rigs; helicopters lost at sea; pipeline fires; refinery explosions; and coal mine accidents: there are tens of fossil-chain fatalities per year in Britain.</p><p>So, let‚Äôs discuss the actual death rates of a range of electricity sources. The death rates vary a lot from country to country. In China, for example, the death rate in coal mines, per ton of coal delivered, is 50 times that of most nations. Figure 24.11 shows numbers from studies by the Paul Scherrer Institute and by a European Union project called ExternE, which made comprehensive estimates of all the impacts of energy production. According to the EU figures, coal, lignite, and oil have the highest death rates, followed by peat and biomass-power, with death rates above 1 per GWy. Nuclear and wind are the best, with death rates below 0.2 per GWy. <sup id="fnref-15"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap24/#fn-15">15</a></sup> Hydroelectricity is the best of all according to the EU study, but comes out worst in the Paul Scherrer Institute‚Äôs study, because the latter surveyed a different set of countries.</p><h3 id="inherently-safe-nuclear-power">Inherently safe nuclear power</h3><p>Spurred on by worries about nuclear accidents, engineers have devised many new reactors with improved safety features.

It‚Äôs conventional to keep the high-level waste at the reactor for its first 40 years. It is stored in pools of water and cooled. After 40 years, the level of radioactivity has dropped 1000-fold. The level of radioactivity continues to fall; after 1000 years, if we <em>reprocess</em> the waste, separating off the uranium and plutonium for use in new nuclear fuel, then after 1000 years, the radioactivity of the high-level waste is about the same as that of uranium ore. Thus waste storage engineers need to make a plan to secure high-level waste for about 1000 years. <sup id="fnref-17"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap24/#fn-17">17</a></sup></p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure201.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 24.13</span>.

Even when we multiply by 60 million people, the lifetime volume of nuclear waste doesn‚Äôt sound unmanageable: 105 000 cubic metres. That‚Äôs the same volume as 35 olympic swimming pools.

And because we‚Äôve carefully expressed everything in this book in a single set of units, it‚Äôs quite easy to answer. First, let‚Äôs recap the key numbers about global energy balance from <a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 " href="../Text/chap01.xhtml#Carbon">chapter 1</a>: the average solar power absorbed by atmosphere, land, and oceans is 238 W/m<sup>2</sup>; doubling the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration would effectively increase the net heating by 4 W/m<sup>2</sup>. This 1.7% increase in heating is believed to be bad news for climate. Variations in solar power during the 11-year solar cycle have a range of 0.25 W/m<sup>2</sup>. So now let‚Äôs assume that in 100 years or so, the world population is 10 billion, and everyone is living at a European standard of living, using 125 kWh per day derived from fossil sources, from nuclear power, or from mined geothermal power. The area of the earth per person would be 51 000 m<sup>2</sup>. Dividing the power per person by the area per person, we find that the extra power contributed by human energy use would be 0.1 W/m<sup>2</sup>. That‚Äôs one fortieth of the 4 W/m<sup>2</sup> that we‚Äôre currently fretting about, and a little smaller than the 0.25 W/m<sup>2</sup> effect of solar variations. So yes, under these assumptions, human power production would <em>just</em> show up as a contributor to global climate change.</p><h4 id="i-heard-that-nuclear-power-cant-be-built-at-a-sufficient-rate-to-make-a-useful-contribution">I heard that nuclear power can‚Äôt be built at a sufficient rate to make a useful contribution.</h4><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure202.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 24.14</span>.

Our knowledge of geology is such that we can be confident that identified resources of metal minerals are a small fraction of what is there. ‚ÄúMeasured resources of uranium, the amount known to be economically recoverable from orebodies, are ‚Ä¶ dependent on the intensity of past exploration effort, and are basically a statement about what is known rather than what is there in the Earth‚Äôs crust. ‚ÄúThe world‚Äôs present measured resources of uranium (5.5 Mt) ‚Ä¶ are enough to last for over 80 years.

See also Jones (1984). These death rates are from studies that are predicting the future. We can also look in the past. In Britain, nuclear power has generated 200 GWy of electricity, and the nuclear industry has had 1 fatality, a worker who died at Chapelcross in 1978 [<a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 " href="http://tinyurl.com/4f2ekz"><span class="websitetitle">4f2ekz</span></a>]. One death per 200 GWy is an impressively low death rate compared with the fossil fuel industry. Worldwide, the nuclear-power historical death rate is hard to estimate. The Three Mile Island meltdown killed no-one, and the associated leaks are estimated to have perhaps killed one person in the time since the accident. The accident at Chernobyl first killed 62 who died directly from exposure, and 15 local people who died later of thyroid cancer; it‚Äôs estimated that nearby, another 4000 died of cancer, and that worldwide, about 5000 people (among 7 million who were exposed to fallout) died of cancer because of Chernobyl (Williams and Baverstock, 2006); but these deaths are impossible to detect because cancers, many of them caused by natural nuclear radiation, already cause 25% of deaths in Europe. One way to estimate a global death rate from nuclear power worldwide is to divide this estimate of Chernobyl‚Äôs deathtoll (9000 deaths) by the cumulative output of nuclear power from 1969 to 1996, which was 3685 GWy. This gives a death rate of 2.4 deaths per GWy.

In the mid-1990s the mortality rate associated with wind power was 3.5 deaths per GWy. According to Paul Gipe, the worldwide mortality rate of wind power dropped to 1.3 deaths per GWy by the end of 2000.

See also Jones (1984). These death rates are from studies that are predicting the future. We can also look in the past. In Britain, nuclear power has generated 200 GWy of electricity, and the nuclear industry has had 1 fatality, a worker who died at Chapelcross in 1978 [\",mdx(\"a\",e({parentName:\"li\"},{href:\"http://tinyurl.com/4f2ekz\"}),mdx(\"span\",{class:\"websitetitle\"},\"4f2ekz\")),\"]. One death per 200 GWy is an impressively low death rate compared with the fossil fuel industry. Worldwide, the nuclear-power historical death rate is hard to estimate. The Three Mile Island meltdown killed no-one, and the associated leaks are estimated to have perhaps killed one person in the time since the accident. The accident at Chernobyl first killed 62 who died directly from exposure, and 15 local people who died later of thyroid cancer; it\\u2019s estimated that nearby, another 4000 died of cancer, and that worldwide, about 5000 people (among 7 million who were exposed to fallout) died of cancer because of Chernobyl (Williams and Baverstock, 2006); but these deaths are impossible to detect because cancers, many of them caused by natural nuclear radiation, already cause 25% of deaths in Europe. One way to estimate a global death rate from nuclear power worldwide is to divide this estimate of Chernobyl\\u2019s deathtoll (9000 deaths) by the cumulative output of nuclear power from 1969 to 1996, which was 3685 GWy. This gives a death rate of 2.4 deaths per GWy. As for deaths attributed to wind, Caithness Windfarm Information Forum \",mdx(\"a\",e({parentName:\"li\"},{href:\"http://www.caithnesswindfarms.co.uk/\"}),mdx(\"span\",{class:\"websitetitle\"},\"www.caithnesswindfarms.co.uk\")),\" list 49 fatalities worldwide from 1970 to 2007 (35 wind industry workers and 14 members of the public). In 2007, Paul Gipe listed 34 deaths total worldwide [\",mdx(\"a\",e({parentName:\"li\"},{href:\"http://www.wind-works.org/articles/BreathLife.html\"}),mdx(\"span\",{class:\"websitetitle\"},\"www.wind-works.org/articles/BreathLife.html\")),\"]. In the mid-1990s the mortality rate associated with wind power was 3.5 deaths per GWy. According to Paul Gipe, the worldwide mortality rate of wind power dropped to 1.3 deaths per GWy by the end of 2000. So the historical death rates of both nuclear power and wind are higher than the predicted future death rates.\",mdx(\"a\",e({parentName:\"li\"},{href:\"#fnref-15\",className:\"footnote-backref\"}),\"\\u21A9\")),mdx(\"li\",e({parentName:\"ol\"},{id:\"fn-16\"}),mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"li\"},\"The steel and concrete in a 1 GW nuclear power station have a carbon footprint of roughly 300 000 t CO\",mdx(\"sub\",null,\"2\")),\".
