Minimum energy requirement of one person.<p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure90.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 13.3</span>. Milk and cheese.<p>We‚Äôve already discussed in Chapter 6 how much sustainable power could be <em>produced</em> through greenery; in this chapter we discuss how much power is currently <em>consumed</em> in giving us our daily bread.</p><p>A moderately active person with a weight of 65 kg consumes food with a chemical energy content of about 2600 ‚ÄúCalories‚Äù per day. A ‚ÄúCalorie,‚Äù in food circles, is actually 1000 chemist‚Äôs calories (1 kcal). 2600 ‚ÄúCalories‚Äù per day is about 3 kWh per day. Most of this energy eventually escapes from the body as heat, so one function of a typical person is to act as a space heater with an output of a little over 100 W, a medium-power lightbulb. Put 10 people in a small cold room, and you can switch off the 1 kW convection heater.</p><p>How much energy do we actually consume in order to get our 3 kWh per day? If we enlarge our viewpoint to include the inevitable upstream costs of food production, then we may find that our energy footprint is substantially bigger. It depends if we are vegan, vegetarian or carnivore.</p><p>The vegan has the smallest inevitable footprint: <span class="red">3 kWh per day</span> of energy from the plants he eats.</p><h3 id="the-energy-cost-of-drinking-milk">The energy cost of drinking milk</h3><p>I love milk. If I drinka-pinta-milka-day, what energy does that require? A typical dairy cow produces 16 litres of milk per day. <sup id="fnref-1"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap13/#fn-1">1</a></sup> So my one pint per day (half a litre per day) requires that I employ <sup>1</sup>‚ÅÑ<sub>32</sub> of a cow. Oh, hang on ‚Äì I love cheese too. And to make 1 kg of Irish Cheddar takes about 9 kg of milk. So consuming 50 g of cheese per day requires the production of an extra 450 g of milk. OK: my milk and cheese habit requires that I employ <sup>1</sup>‚ÅÑ<sub>16</sub> of a cow. And how much power does it take to run a cow? Well, if a cow weighing 450 kg has similar energy requirements per kilogram to a human (whose 65 kg burns 3 kWh per day) then the cow must be using about 21 kWh/d. Does this extrapolation from human to cow make you uneasy? Let‚Äôs check these numbers: <span class="websitetitle"><a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="http://www.dairyaustralia.com.au">www.dairyaustralia.com.au</a></span> says that a suckling cow of weight 450 kg needs 85 MJ/d, which is 24 kWh/d. Great, our guess wasn‚Äôt far off<!-- -->!<!-- --> So my <sup>1</sup>‚ÅÑ<sub>16</sub> share of a cow has an energy consumption of about <span class="red">1.5 kWh per day</span>. This figure ignores other energy costs involved in persuading the cow to make milk and the milk to turn to cheese, and of getting the milk and cheese to travel from her to me. We‚Äôll cover some of these costs when we discuss freight and supermarkets in Chapter 15.</p><h3 id="eggs">Eggs</h3><p>A ‚Äúlayer‚Äù (a chicken that lays eggs) eats about 110 g of chicken feed per day. Assuming that chicken feed has a metabolizable energy content of 3.3 kWh per kg, that‚Äôs a power consumption of 0.4 kWh per day per chicken. Layers yield on average 290 eggs per year. So eating two eggs a day requires a power of <span class="red">1 kWh per day</span>. Each egg itself contains 80 kcal, which is about 0.1 kWh. So from an energy point of view, egg production is 20% efficient.</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure91.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 13.4</span>. Two eggs per day.<p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure92.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 13.5</span>. Eating meat requires extra power because we have to feed the queue of animals lining up to be eaten by the human.<h3 id="the-energy-cost-of-eating-meat">The energy cost of eating meat</h3><p>Let‚Äôs say an enthusiastic meat-eater eats about half a pound a day (227 g). (This is the average meat consumption of Americans.) To work out the power required to maintain the meat-eater‚Äôs animals as they mature and wait for the chop, we need to know for how long the animals are around, consuming energy. Chicken, pork, or beef?</p><p>Chicken, sir? Every chicken you eat was clucking around being a chicken for roughly 50 days. So the steady consumption of half a pound a day of chicken requires about 25 pounds of chicken to be alive, preparing to be eaten. And those 25 pounds of chicken consume energy.</p><p>Pork, madam? Pigs are around for longer ‚Äì maybe 400 days from birth to bacon ‚Äì so the steady consumption of half a pound a day of pork requires about 200 pounds of pork to be alive, preparing to be eaten.</p><p>Cow? Beef production involves the longest lead times. It takes about 1000 days of cow-time to create a steak. <sup id="fnref-2"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap13/#fn-2">2</a></sup> So the steady consumption of half a pound a day of beef requires about 500 pounds of beef to be alive, preparing to be eaten.</p><p>To condense all these ideas down to a single number, let‚Äôs assume you eat half a pound (227 g) per day of meat, made up of equal quantities of chicken, pork, and beef. <sup id="fnref-3"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap13/#fn-3">3</a></sup> This meat habit requires the perpetual sustenance of 8 pounds of chicken meat, 70 pounds of pork meat, and 170 pounds of cow meat. That‚Äôs a total of 110 kg of meat, or 170 kg of animal (since about two thirds of the animal gets turned into meat). And if the 170 kg of animal has similar power requirements to a human (whose 65 kg burns 3 kWh/d) then the power required to fuel the meat habit is</p><p>[\text{170\ kg} \times \frac{\left. \text{3\ kWh}/\text{d} \right.}{\text{65\ kg}} \simeq \left. \text{8\ kWh}/\text{d} \right.]</p><p>I‚Äôve again taken the physiological liberty of assuming ‚Äúanimals are like humans;‚Äù a more accurate estimate of the energy to make chicken is in this chapter‚Äôs endnotes. <sup id="fnref-4"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap13/#fn-4">4</a></sup> No matter, I only want a ballpark estimate, and here it is. The power required to make the food for a typical consumer of vegetables, dairy, eggs, and meat is 1.5 + 1.5 + 1 + 8 = <span class="red">12 kWh per day</span>. (The daily calorific balance of this rough diet is 1.5 kWh from vegetables; 0.7 kWh from dairy; 0.2 kWh from eggs; and 0.5 kWh from meat ‚Äì a total of 2.9 kWh per day.)</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure93.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 13.6</span>. Will harvest energy crops for food.<p>This number does not include any of the power costs associated with farming, fertilizing, processing, refrigerating, and transporting the food. We‚Äôll estimate some of those costs below, and some in Chapter 15.</p><p>Do these calculations give an argument in favour of vegetarianism, on the grounds of lower energy consumption? It depends on where the animals feed. Take the steep hills and mountains of Wales, for example. Could the land be used for anything other than grazing? Either these rocky pasturelands are used to sustain sheep, or they are not used to help feed humans. You can think of these natural green slopes as maintenance-free biofuel plantations, and the sheep as automated self-replicating biofuel harvesting machines. The energy losses between sunlight and mutton are substantial, but there is probably no better way of capturing solar power in such places. (I‚Äôm not sure whether this argument for sheep-farming in Wales actually adds up: during the worst weather, Welsh sheep are moved to lower fields where their diet is supplemented with soya feed and other food grown with the help of energy-intensive fertilizers; what‚Äôs the true energy cost? I don‚Äôt know.) Similar arguments can be made in favour of carnivory for places such as the scrublands of Africa and the grasslands of Australia; and in favour of dairy consumption in India, where millions of cows are fed on by-products of rice and maize farming.</p><p>On the other hand, where animals are reared in cages and fed grain that humans could have eaten, there‚Äôs no question that it would be more energy-efficient to cut out the middlehen or middlesow, and feed the grain directly to humans.</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure94.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 13.7</span>.

It‚Äôs certainly possible to find food whose fossil-fuel energy footprint is bigger than the energy delivered to the human. A bag of crisps, for example, has an embodied energy of 1.4 kWh of fossil fuel per kWh of chemical energy eaten. <sup id="fnref-7"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap13/#fn-7">7</a></sup> The embodied energy of meat is higher. According to a study from the University of Exeter, the typical diet has an embodied energy of roughly 6 kWh per kWh eaten. <sup id="fnref-8"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap13/#fn-8">8</a></sup> To figure out whether driving a car or walking uses less energy, we need to know the transport efficiency of each mode. For the typical car of Chapter 3, the energy cost was 80 kWh per 100 km. Walking uses a net energy of 3.6 kWh per 100 km <sup id="fnref-9"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap13/#fn-9">9</a></sup> ‚Äì 22 times less. So if you live entirely on food whose footprint is greater than 22 kWh per kWh then, yes, the energy cost of getting you from A to B in a fossil-fuel-powered vehicle is less than if you go under your own steam. But if you have a typical diet (6 kWh per kWh) then ‚Äúit‚Äôs better to drive than to walk‚Äù is a myth. Walking uses one quarter as much energy.</p><h2 id="notes-and-further-reading">Notes and further reading</h2><p>If I‚Äôd used this number instead of my rough guess, the energy contribution of the chicken would have been bumped up a little. But given that the mixed-meat diet‚Äôs energy footprint is dominated by the beef, it really doesn‚Äôt matter that I underestimated the chickens.
