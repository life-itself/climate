Revenge of Gaia: Why the earth is Ô¨Åghting back ‚Äì and how we can still save humanity.</em> James Lovelock (2006). ¬© Allen Lane.</p><p>I recently read two books, one by a physicist, and one by an economist. In <em>Out of Gas</em>, Caltech physicist David Goodstein describes an impending energy crisis brought on by The End of the Age of Oil. This crisis is coming soon, he predicts: the crisis will bite, not when the last drop of oil is extracted, but when oil extraction can‚Äôt meet demand ‚Äì perhaps as soon as 2015 or 2025. Moreover, even if we magically switched all our energy guzzling to nuclear power right away, Goodstein says, the oil crisis would simply be replaced by a <em>nuclear</em> crisis in just twenty years or so, as uranium reserves also became depleted.</p><p>In <em>The Skeptical Environmentalist</em>, Bj√∏rn Lomborg paints a completely different picture. ‚ÄúEverything is Ô¨Åne.‚Äù Indeed, ‚Äúeverything is getting better.‚Äù Furthermore, ‚Äúwe are not headed for a major energy crisis,‚Äù and ‚Äúthere is plenty of energy.‚Äù</p><p>How could two smart people come to such different conclusions? I had to get to the bottom of this.</p><p>Energy made it into the British news in 2006. Kindled by tidings of great climate change and a tripling in the price of natural gas in just six years, the Ô¨Çames of debate are raging. How should Britain handle its energy needs? And how should the world?</p><p>‚ÄúWind or nuclear?‚Äù, for example. Greater polarization of views among smart people is hard to imagine. During a discussion of the proposed expansion of nuclear power, Michael Meacher, former environment minister, said ‚Äúif we‚Äôre going to cut greenhouse gases by 60% ‚Ä¶ by 2050 there is no other possible way of doing that except through renewables;‚Äù Sir Bernard Ingham, former civil servant, speaking in favour of nuclear expansion, said ‚Äúanybody who is relying upon renewables to Ô¨Åll the <!-- -->[energy]<!-- --> gap is living in an utter dream world and is, in my view, an enemy of the people.‚Äù <sup id="fnref-1"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap01/#fn-1">1</a></sup><span class="red"> <!-- -->*</span></p><span class="red">\*</span> Every chapter has endnotes giving references, sources, and details of arguments.

All agree that <em>something</em> must be done urgently, but <em>what?</em> Jonathon Porritt <sup id="fnref-2"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap01/#fn-2">2</a></sup>, chair of the Sustainable Development Commission, writes: ‚Äúthere is no justiÔ¨Åcation for bringing forward plans for a new nuclear power programme at this time, and ‚Ä¶ any such proposal would be incompatible with <!-- -->[the Government‚Äôs]<!-- --> sustainable development strategy;‚Äù and ‚Äúa nonnuclear strategy could and should be sufÔ¨Åcient to deliver all the carbon savings we shall need up to 2050 and beyond, and to ensure secure access to reliable sources of energy.‚Äù In contrast, environmentalist James Lovelock writes in his book, <em>The Revenge of Gaia</em>: ‚ÄúNow is much too late to establish sustainable development.‚Äù In his view, power from nuclear Ô¨Åssion, while not recommended as the long-term panacea for our ailing planet, is ‚Äúthe only effective medicine we have now.‚Äù Onshore wind turbines are ‚Äúmerely ‚Ä¶ a gesture to prove <!-- -->[our leaders‚Äô]<!-- --> environmental credentials.‚Äù</p><p>This heated debate is fundamentally about numbers. How much energy could each source deliver, at what economic and social cost, and with what risks? But actual numbers are rarely mentioned. In public debates, people just say ‚ÄúNuclear is a money pit‚Äù or ‚ÄúWe have a <em>huge</em> amount of wave and wind.‚Äù <sup id="fnref-3"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap01/#fn-3">3</a></sup> The trouble with this sort of language is that it‚Äôs not sufÔ¨Åcient to know that something is huge: we need to know how the one ‚Äúhuge‚Äù compares with another ‚Äúhuge,‚Äù namely <em>our huge energy consumption</em>. To make this comparison, we need numbers, not adjectives.</p><p>Where numbers are used, their meaning is often obfuscated by enormousness. Numbers are chosen to impress, to score points in arguments, rather than to inform. ‚ÄúLos Angeles residents drive 142 million miles ‚Äì the distance from Earth to Mars ‚Äì every single day. <sup id="fnref-4"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap01/#fn-4">4</a></sup>‚Äù ‚ÄúEach year, 27 million acres of tropical rainforest are destroyed.‚Äù ‚Äú14 billion pounds of trash are dumped into the sea every year.‚Äù ‚ÄúBritish people throw away 2.6 billion slices of bread per year.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe waste paper buried each year in the UK could Ô¨Åll 103448 double-decker buses.‚Äù</p><p>If all the ineffective ideas for solving the energy crisis were laid end to end, they would reach to the moon and back‚Ä¶ I digress.</p><p>The result of this lack of meaningful numbers and facts? We are inundated with a Ô¨Çood of crazy innumerate codswallop. The BBC doles out advice on how we can do our bit to save the planet ‚Äì for example ‚Äúswitch off your mobile phone charger when it‚Äôs not in use;‚Äù if anyone objects that mobile phone chargers are not <em>actually</em> our number one form of energy consumption, the mantra ‚Äúevery little helps‚Äù is wheeled out. Every little helps? A more realistic mantra is:</p><blockquote><p><em>if everyone does a little, we‚Äôll achieve only a little.</em></p></blockquote><p>For the beneÔ¨Åt of readers who speak American, rather than English, the translation of ‚Äúevery little helps‚Äù into American is ‚Äúevery little bit helps.‚Äù</p><p>Companies also contribute to the daily codswallop as they tell us how wonderful they are, or how they can help us ‚Äúdo our bit.‚Äù BP‚Äôs website, for example, celebrates the reductions in carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) pollution they hope to achieve by changing the paint used for painting BP‚Äôs ships. Does anyone fall for this? Surely everyone will guess that it‚Äôs not the exterior paint job, it‚Äôs the stuff <em>inside</em> the tanker that deserves attention, if society‚Äôs CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are to be signiÔ¨Åcantly cut?

This graph shows the predicted capacity of nuclear, coal, and oil power stations, in kilowatt-hours per day per person. The capacity is the maximum deliverable power of a source.<h2 id="why-are-we-discussing-energy-policy">Why are we discussing energy policy?</h2><p>Three different motivations drive today‚Äôs energy discussions.</p><p>First, fossil fuels are a Ô¨Ånite resource. It seems possible that cheap oil (on which our cars and lorries run) and cheap gas (with which we heat many of our buildings) will run out in our lifetime. So we seek alternative energy sources. Indeed given that fossil fuels are a valuable resource, useful for manufacture of plastics and all sorts of other creative stuff, perhaps we should save them for better uses than simply setting Ô¨Åre to them.</p><p>Second, we‚Äôre interested in security of energy supply. Even if fossil fuels are still available somewhere in the world, perhaps we don‚Äôt want to depend on them if that would make our economy vulnerable to the whims of untrustworthy foreigners. (I hope you can hear my tongue in my cheek.) Going by Ô¨Ågure 1.2, it certainly looks as if ‚Äúour‚Äù fossil fuels have peaked. The UK has a particular security-of-supply problem looming, known as the ‚Äúenergy gap.‚Äù A substantial number of old coal power stations and nuclear power stations will be closing down during the next decade (Ô¨Ågure 1.3), so there is a risk that electricity demand will sometimes exceed electricity supply, if adequate plans are not implemented.</p><p>Third, it‚Äôs very probable that using fossil fuels changes the climate. Climate change is blamed on several human activities, but the biggest contributor to climate change is the increase in greenhouse effect produced by carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). Most of the carbon dioxide emissions come from fossil-fuel burning. And the main reason we burn fossil fuels is for energy. So to Ô¨Åx climate change, we need to sort out a new way of getting energy. The climate problem is mostly an energy problem.</p><p>Whichever of these three concerns motivates you, we need energy numbers, and policies that add up.</p><p>The Ô¨Årst two concerns are straightforward selÔ¨Åsh motivations for drastically reducing fossil fuel use. The third concern, climate change, is a more altruistic motivation ‚Äì the brunt of climate change will be borne not by us but by future generations over many hundreds of years. Some people feel that climate change is not their responsibility. They say things like ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point in my doing anything? China‚Äôs out of control<!-- -->!<!-- -->‚Äù So I‚Äôm going to discuss climate change a bit more now, because while writing this book I learned some interesting facts that shed light on these ethical questions. If you have no interest in climate change, feel free to fast-forward to the next section.</p><h2 id="the-climate-change-motivation">The climate-change motivation</h2><p>The climate-change motivation is argued in three steps: one: human fossilfuel burning causes carbon dioxide concentrations to rise; two: carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas; three: increasing the greenhouse effect increases average global temperatures (and has many other effects).</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure6.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 1.4.</span> Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations (in parts per million) for the last 1100 years, measured from air trapped in ice cores (up to 1977) and directly in Hawaii (from 1958 onwards).<p>I think something new may have happened between 1800 AD and 2000 AD. I‚Äôve marked the year 1769, in which James Watt patented his steam engine. (The Ô¨Årst practical steam engine was invented 70 years earlier in 1698 <sup id="fnref-11"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap01/#fn-11">11</a></sup>, but Watt‚Äôs was much more efÔ¨Åcient.) <sup id="fnref-12"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap01/#fn-12">12</a></sup></p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure13.gif" alt=" "/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 1.5.</span> The history of UK coal production and world coal production from 1600 to 1910. Production rates are shown in billions of tons of CO<sub>2</sub> ‚Äì an incomprehensible unit, yes, but don‚Äôt worry: we‚Äôll personalize it shortly.<p>We start with the fact that carbon dioxide concentrations are rising. Figure 1.4 shows measurements of the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the air from the year 1000AD to the present. Some ‚Äúsceptics‚Äù have asserted that the recent increase in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is a natural phenomenon. Does ‚Äúsceptic‚Äù mean ‚Äúa person who has not even glanced at the data‚Äù? Don‚Äôt you think, just possibly, <em>something</em> may have happened between 1800AD and 2000AD? Something that was not part of the natural processes present in the preceding thousand years?</p><p>Something did happen, and it was called the Industrial Revolution. I‚Äôve marked on the graph the year 1769, in which James Watt patented his steam engine. While the Ô¨Årst practical steam engine was invented in 1698, Watt‚Äôs more efÔ¨Åcient steam engine really got the Industrial Revolution going. One of the steam engine‚Äôs main applications was the pumping of water out of coal mines. Figure 1.5 shows what happened to British coal production from 1769 onwards. The Ô¨Ågure displays coal production in units of billions of tons of CO<sub>2</sub> released when the coal was burned. In 1800, coal was used to make iron, to make ships, to heat buildings, to power locomotives and other machinery, and of course to power the pumps that enabled still more coal to be scraped up from inside the hills of England and Wales. Britain was terribly well endowed with coal: when the Revolution started, the amount of carbon sitting in coal under Britain was roughly the same as the amount sitting in oil under Saudi Arabia.</p><p>In the 30 years from 1769 to 1800, Britain‚Äôs annual coal production doubled. After another 30 years (1830), it had doubled again. The next doubling of production-rate happened within <em>20</em> years (1850), and another doubling within 20 years of that (1870). This coal allowed Britain to turn the globe pink. The prosperity that came to England and Wales was reÔ¨Çected in a century of unprecedented population growth:</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure14.gif" alt="population England"/></p><p>Eventually other countries got in on the act too as the Revolution spread. Figure 1.6 shows British coal production and world coal production on the same scale as Ô¨Ågure 1.5, sliding the window of history 50 years later. British coal production peaked in 1910, but meanwhile world coal production continued to double every 20 years. It‚Äôs difÔ¨Åcult to show the history of coal production on a single graph. To show what happened in the <em>next</em> 50 years on the same scale, the book would need to be one metre tall<!-- -->!<!-- --> To cope with this difÔ¨Åculty, we can either scale down the vertical axis:</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure15.gif" alt="population world"/></p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure16.gif" alt="UK and world coal production"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 1.6.</span> What happened next. The history of UK coal production and world coal production from 1650 to 1960, on the same scale as Ô¨Ågure 1.5.<p>or we can squish the vertical axis in a non-uniform way, so that small quantities and large quantities can be seen at the same time on a single graph. A good way to squish the axis is called a logarithmic scale, and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve used in the bottom two graphs of Ô¨Ågure 1.7. On a logarithmic scale, all ten-fold increases (from 1 to 10, from 10 to 100, from 100 to 1000) are represented by equal distances on the page. On a logarithmic scale, a quantity that grows at a constant percentage per year (which is called ‚Äúexponential growth‚Äù) looks like a straight line. Logarithmic graphs are great for understanding growth. Whereas the ordinary graphs in the Ô¨Ågures on pages 6 and 7 convey the messages that British and world coal production grew remarkably, and that British and world population grew remarkably, the relative growth rates are not evident in these ordinary graphs. The logarithmic graphs allow us to compare growth rates. Looking at the slopes of the population curves, for example, we can see that the world population‚Äôs growth rate in the last 50 years was a little bigger than the growth rate of England and Wales in 1800.</p><p>From 1769 to 2006, world annual coal production increased 800-fold. Coal production is still increasing today. Other fossil fuels are being extracted too ‚Äì the middle graph of Ô¨Ågure 1.7 shows oil production for example ‚Äì but in terms of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, coal is still king.</p><p>The burning of fossil fuels is the principal reason why CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations have gone up. This is a fact, but, hang on: I hear a persistent buzzing noise coming from a bunch of climate-change inactivists. What are they saying? Here‚Äôs Dominic Lawson, a columnist from the <em>Independent</em>:</p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúThe burning of fossil fuels sends about <span class="red">seven gigatons</span> of CO<sub>2</sub> per year into the atmosphere, which sounds like a lot.

Reducing man-made CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is megalomania, exaggerating man‚Äôs signiÔ¨Åcance. Politicians can‚Äôt change the weather.‚Äù <sup id="fnref-13"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap01/#fn-13">13</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>Now I have a lot of time for scepticism, and not everything that sceptics say is a crock of manure ‚Äì but irresponsible journalism like Dominic Lawson‚Äôs deserves a good Ô¨Çushing.</p><p>The Ô¨Årst problem with Lawson‚Äôs offering is that <em>all three numbers</em> that he mentions (<span class="red">seven</span>, <span class="green">1900</span>, and <span class="darkblue">36000</span>) are <em>wrong<!-- -->!</em> The correct numbers are <span class="red">26</span>, <span class="green">440</span>, and <span class="darkblue">330</span>. Leaving these errors to one side, let‚Äôs address Lawson‚Äôs main point, the relative smallness of man-made emissions.</p><p>Yes, natural Ô¨Çows of CO<sub>2</sub> <em>are</em> larger than the additional Ô¨Çow we switched on 200 years ago when we started burning fossil fuels in earnest. But it is terribly misleading to quantify only the large natural Ô¨Çows <em>into</em> the atmosphere, failing to mention the almost exactly equal Ô¨Çows <em>out</em> of the atmosphere back into the biosphere and the oceans. The point is that these <em>natural</em> Ô¨Çows in and out of the atmosphere have been almost exactly in balance for millenia. So it‚Äôs not relevant at all that these natural Ô¨Çows are larger than human emissions. The natural Ô¨Çows <em>cancelled themselves out</em>. So the natural Ô¨Çows, large though they were, left the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere and ocean <em>constant</em>, over the last few thousand years. Burning fossil fuels, in contrast, creates a <em>new</em> Ô¨Çow of carbon that, though small, is <em>not cancelled</em>. Here‚Äôs a simple analogy, set in the passport-control arrivals area of an airport.</p><p>One thousand passengers arrive per hour, and there are exactly enough clockwork ofÔ¨Åcials to process <span class="darkblue">one thousand pas</span><span class="darkblue">sengers per hour</span>. There‚Äôs a modest queue, but because of the match of arrival rate to service rate, the queue isn‚Äôt getting any longer. Now imagine that owing to fog an extra stream of Ô¨Çights is diverted here from a smaller airport. This stream adds an extra <span class="red">50 passengers per hour</span> to the arrivals lobby ‚Äì a small addition compared to the original arrival rate of one thousand per hour. Initially at least, the authorities don‚Äôt increase the number of ofÔ¨Åcials, and the ofÔ¨Åcials carry on processing just one thousand passengers per hour. So what happens? Slowly but surely, <em>the queue grows</em>. Burning fossil fuels is undeniably increasing the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the atmosphere and in the surface oceans. No climate scientist disputes this fact. When it comes to CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, man <em>is</em> signiÔ¨Åcant.</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure7.gif" alt="CO2 concentrations, consequences of Industrial Revolution"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 1.7.</span> The upper graph shows carbon dioxide CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations (in parts per million) for the last 1100 years ‚Äì the same data that was shown in Ô¨Ågure 1.4.<p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/jw.gif" alt="James Watt"/></p><p>Here‚Äôs a portrait of James Watt and his 1769 steam engine.</p><p>The middle graph shows (on a logarithmic scale) the history of UK coal production, Saudi oil production, world coal production, world oil production, and (by the top right point) the total of all greenhouse gas emissions in the year 2000.

Fossil fuel burning increases CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations signiÔ¨Åcantly. But does it matter? ‚ÄúCarbon is nature<!-- -->!<!-- -->‚Äù, the oilspinners remind us, ‚ÄúCarbon is life<!-- -->!<!-- -->‚Äù If CO<sub>2</sub> had no harmful effects, then indeed carbon emissions would not matter. However, carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. Not the strongest greenhouse gas, but a signiÔ¨Åcant one nonetheless. Put more of it in the atmosphere, and it does what greenhouse gases do: it absorbs infrared radiation (heat) heading out from the earth and reemits it in a random direction; the effect of this random redirection of the atmospheric heat trafÔ¨Åc is to impede the Ô¨Çow of heat from the planet, just like a quilt. So carbon dioxide has a warming effect. <sup id="fnref-14"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap01/#fn-14">14</a></sup> This fact is based not on complex historical records of global temperatures but on the simple physical properties of CO<sub>2</sub> molecules. Greenhouse gases are a quilt, and CO<sub>2</sub> is one layer of the quilt.</p><p>So, if humanity succeeds in doubling or tripling CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations (which is where we are certainly heading, under business as usual), what happens? Here, there is a lot of uncertainty. Climate science is difÔ¨Åcult. The climate is a complex, twitchy beast, and exactly how much warming CO<sub>2</sub> -doubling would produce is uncertain. The consensus of the best climate models seems to be that doubling the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration would have roughly the same effect as increasing the intensity of the sun by 2%, and would bump up the global mean temperature by something like 3¬∞C. This would be what historians call a Bad Thing. I won‚Äôt recite the whole litany of probable drastic effects, as I am sure you‚Äôve heard it before. <sup id="fnref-15"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap01/#fn-15">15</a></sup> The litany begins ‚Äúthe Greenland icecap would gradually melt, and, over a period of a few 100 years, sea-level would rise by about 7 metres.‚Äù The brunt of the litany falls on future generations. Such temperatures have not been seen on earth for at least 100 000 years, and it‚Äôs conceivable that the ecosystem would be so signiÔ¨Åcantly altered that the earth would stop supplying some of the goods and services that we currently take for granted.</p><span id="page11">Climate</span> modelling is difÔ¨Åcult and is dogged by uncertainties. But uncertainty about exactly how the climate will respond to extra greenhouse gases is no justiÔ¨Åcation for inaction. If you were riding a fast-moving motorcycle in fog near a cliff-edge, and you didn‚Äôt have a good map of the cliff, would the lack of a map justify *not* slowing the bike down?<p>So, who should slow the bike down? Who should clean up carbon emissions? Who is responsible for climate change? This is an ethical question, of course, not a scientiÔ¨Åc one, but ethical discussions must be founded on facts. Let‚Äôs now explore the facts about greenhouse gas emissions. First, a word about the units in which they are measured. Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide; each gas has different physical properties; it‚Äôs conventional to express all gas emissions in ‚Äúequivalent amounts of carbon dioxide,‚Äù where ‚Äúequivalent‚Äù means ‚Äúhaving the same warming effect over a period of 100 years.‚Äù One ton of carbon-dioxide-equivalent may be abbreviated as ‚Äú1 t CO<sub>2</sub>e,‚Äù and one billion tons (one thousand million tons) as ‚Äú1 Gt CO<sub>2</sub>e‚Äù (one gigaton). In this book 1 t means one metric ton (1000 kg). I‚Äôm not going to distinguish imperial tons, because they differ by less than 10% from the metric ton or tonne.</p><p>In the year 2000, the world‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions were about 34 billion tons of CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent per year. An incomprehensible number. But we can render it more comprehensible and more personal by dividing by the number of people on the planet, 6 billion, so as to obtain the greenhouse-gas pollution <em>per person</em>, which is about 5¬Ω tons CO<sub>2</sub>e per year per person. We can thus represent the world emissions by a rectangle whose width is the population (6 billion) and whose height is the percapita emissions.</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure9.gif" alt="Greenhouse gas pollution"/></p><p>Now, all people are created equal, but we don‚Äôt all emit 5¬Ω tons of CO<sub>2</sub> per year. We can break down the emissions of the year 2000, showing how the 34-billion-ton rectangle is shared between the regions of the world: <sup id="fnref-16"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap01/#fn-16">16</a></sup></p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure10.gif" alt="Greenhouse gas pollution"/></p><p>This picture, which is on the same scale as the previous one, divides the world into eight regions. Each rectangle‚Äôs area represents the greenhouse gas emissions of one region. The width of the rectangle is the population of the region, and the height is the average per-capita emissions in that region.</p><p>In the year 2000, Europe‚Äôs per-capita greenhouse gas emissions were twice the world average; and North America‚Äôs were four times the world average.</p><p>We can continue subdividing, splitting each of the regions into countries. This is where it gets really interesting:</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure11.gif" alt="Greenhouse gas pollution"/></p><p>The major countries with the biggest per-capita emissions are Australia, the USA, and Canada. European countries, Japan, and South Africa are notable runners up. Among European countries, the United Kingdom is resolutely average. What about China, that naughty ‚Äúout of control‚Äù country? Yes, the area of China‚Äôs rectangle is about the same as the USA‚Äôs, but the fact is that their per-capita emissions are <em>below</em> the world average. India‚Äôs per-capita emissions are less than <em>half</em> the world average. Moreover, it‚Äôs worth bearing in mind that much of the industrial emissions of China and India are associated with the manufacture of <em>stuff for rich countries.</em></p><p>So, assuming that ‚Äúsomething needs to be done‚Äù to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, who has a special responsibility to do something? As I said, that‚Äôs an ethical question. But I Ô¨Ånd it hard to imagine any system of ethics that denies that the responsibility falls especially on the countries to the left hand side of this diagram ‚Äì the countries whose emissions are two, three, or four times the world average. Countries that are most able to pay. Countries like Britain and the USA, for example.</p><h3 id="historical-responsibility-for-climate-impact">Historical responsibility for climate impact</h3><p>If we assume that the climate has been damaged by human activity, and that someone needs to Ô¨Åx it, who should pay? Some people say ‚Äúthe polluter should pay.‚Äù The preceding pictures showed who‚Äôs doing the polluting today. But it isn‚Äôt the <em>rate</em> of CO<sub>2</sub> pollution that matters, it‚Äôs the cumulative <em>total</em> emissions; much of the emitted carbon dioxide (about one third of it) will hang around in the atmosphere for at least 50 or 100 years. If we accept the ethical idea that ‚Äúthe polluter should pay‚Äù then we should ask how big is each country‚Äôs historical footprint. The next picture shows each country‚Äôs cumulative emissions of CO<sub>2</sub>, expressed as an average emission rate over the period 1880‚Äì2004.</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure12.gif" alt="Average pollution rate"/></p><p>Congratulations, Britain<!-- -->!<!-- --> The UK has made it onto the winners‚Äô podium. We may be only an average European country today, but in the table of historical emitters, per capita, we are second only to the USA. <sup id="fnref-17"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap01/#fn-17">17</a></sup></p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure17.gif" alt="Global emissions scenarios"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 1.8.</span> Global emissions for two scenarios considered by Baer and Mastrandrea, expressed in tons of CO<sub>2</sub> per year per person, using a world population of six billion. Both scenarios are believed to offer a modest chance of avoiding a 2¬∞C temperature rise above the pre-industrial level. [^19]<p>OK, that‚Äôs enough ethics. What do scientists reckon needs to be done, to avoid a risk of giving the earth a 2¬∞C temperature rise (2¬∞C being the rise above which they predict lots of bad consequences)? The consensus is clear. We need to get off our fossil fuel habit, and we need to do so fast. Some countries, including Britain, have committed to at least a 60% reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050, <sup id="fnref-18"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap01/#fn-18">18</a></sup> but it must be emphasized that 60% cuts, radical though they are, are unlikely to cut the mustard. If the world‚Äôs emissions were gradually reduced by 60% by 2050, climate scientists reckon it‚Äôs more likely than not that global temperatures will rise by more than 2¬∞C. The sort of cuts we need to aim for are shown in Ô¨Ågure 1.8. This Ô¨Ågure shows two possibly-safe emissions scenarios presented by Baer and Mastrandrea (2006) in a report from the Institute for Public Policy Research. The lower curve assumes that a decline in emissions started in 2007, with total global emissions falling at roughly 5% per year. The upper curve assumes a brief delay in the start of the decline, and a 4% drop per year in global emissions. Both scenarios are believed to offer a modest chance of avoiding a 2¬∞C temperature rise above the pre-industrial level. In the lower scenario, the chance that the temperature rise will <em>exceed</em> 2¬∞C is estimated to be 9‚Äì26%. In the upper scenario, the chance of exceeding 2¬∞C is estimated to be 16‚Äì43%. These possibly-safe emissions trajectories, by the way, involve signiÔ¨Åcantly sharper reductions in emissions than any of the scenarios presented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), or by the Stern Review (2007).</p><p>These possibly-safe trajectories require global emissions to fall by 70% or 85% by 2050. What would this mean for a country like Britain? If we subscribe to the idea of ‚Äúcontraction and convergence,‚Äù which means that all countries aim eventually to have equal per-capita emissions, then Britain needs to aim for cuts greater than 85%: it should get down from its current 11 tons of CO<sub>2</sub>e per year per person to roughly <span class="red">1 ton per year per</span> <span class="red">person</span> by 2050. This is such a deep cut, I suggest the best way to think about it is <em>no more fossil fuels.</em></p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure8.gif" alt="World greenhouse gas emissions"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 1.9.</span> Breakdown of world greenhouse-gas emissions (2000) by cause and by gas. &quot;Energy&quot; includes power stations, industrial processes, transport, fossil fuel processing, and energy-use in buildings. &quot;Land use, biomass burning&quot; means changes in land use, deforestation, and the burning of un-renewed biomass such as peat. &quot;Waste&quot; includes waste disposal and treatment.

Source: Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research.<p>One last thing about the climate-change motivation: while a range of human activities cause greenhouse-gas emissions, the biggest cause by far is <strong>energy use</strong>. Some people justify not doing anything about their energy use by excuses such as ‚Äúmethane from burping cows causes more warming than jet travel.‚Äù Yes, agricultural by-products contributed one eighth of greenhouse-gas emissions in the year 2000.

I‚Äôm going to assume we are motivated to get off fossil fuels. Whatever your motivation, the aim of this book is to help you Ô¨Ågure out the numbers and do the arithmetic so that you can evaluate policies; and to lay a factual foundation so that you can see <em>which proposals add up</em>. I‚Äôm not claiming that the arithmetic and numbers in this book are new; the books I‚Äôve mentioned by Goodstein, Lomborg, and Lovelock, for example, are full of interesting numbers and back-of-envelope calculations, and there are many other helpful sources on the internet too. <sup id="fnref-20"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap01/#fn-20">20</a></sup></p><p>What I‚Äôm aiming to do in this book is to make these numbers simple and memorable; to show you how you can Ô¨Ågure out the numbers for yourself; and to make the situation so clear that any thinking reader will be able to draw striking conclusions. I don‚Äôt want to feed you my own conclusions. Convictions are stronger if they are self-generated, rather than taught. Understanding is a creative process. When you‚Äôve read this book I hope you‚Äôll have reinforced the conÔ¨Ådence that you can Ô¨Ågure anything out.</p><p>I‚Äôd like to emphasize that the calculations we will do are deliberately imprecise. SimpliÔ¨Åcation is a key to understanding. First, by rounding the numbers, we can make them easier to remember. Second, rounded numbers allow quick calculations. For example, in this book, the population of the United Kingdom is 60 million, and the population of the world is 6 billion. I‚Äôm perfectly capable of looking up more accurate Ô¨Ågures, but accuracy would get in the way of Ô¨Çuent thought. For example, if we learn that the world‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions in 2000 were 34 billion tons of CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent per year, then we can instantly note, without a calculator, that the average emissions per person are 5 or 6 tons of CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent per person per year. This rough answer is not exact, but it‚Äôs accurate enough to inform interesting conversations. For instance, if you learn that a roundtrip intercontinental Ô¨Çight emits nearly two tons of CO<sub>2</sub> per passenger, then knowing the average emissions yardstick (5-and-a-bit tons per year per person) helps you realize that just one such plane-trip per year corresponds to over a third of the average person‚Äôs carbon emissions.</p><p>I like to base my calculations on everyday knowledge rather than on trawling through impersonal national statistics. For example, if I want to estimate the typical wind speeds in Cambridge, I ask ‚Äúis my cycling speed usually faster than the wind?‚Äù The answer is yes. So I can deduce that the wind speed in Cambridge is only rarely faster than my typical cycling speed of 20km/h. I back up these everyday estimates with other peoples‚Äô calculations and with ofÔ¨Åcial statistics. (Please look for these in each chapter‚Äôs end-notes.) This book isn‚Äôt intended to be a deÔ¨Ånitive store of super-accurate numbers. Rather, it‚Äôs intended to illustrate how to use approximate numbers as a part of constructive consensual conversations.</p><p>In the calculations, I‚Äôll mainly use the United Kingdom and occasionally Europe, America, or the whole world, but you should Ô¨Ånd it easy to redo the calculations for whatever country or region you are interested in.</p><p>Let me close this chapter with a few more warnings to the reader. Not only will we make a habit of approximating the numbers we calculate; we‚Äôll also neglect all sorts of details that investors, managers, and economists have to attend to, poor folks. If you‚Äôre trying to launch a renewable technology, just a 5% increase in costs may make all the difference between success and failure, so in business every detail must be tracked. But 5% is too small for this book‚Äôs radar. This is a book about factors of 2 and factors of 10. It‚Äôs about physical limits to sustainable energy, not current economic feasibility. While economics is always changing, the fundamental limits won‚Äôt ever go away. We need to understand these limits.</p><p>Debates about energy policy are often confusing and emotional because people mix together <em>factual</em> assertions and <em>ethical</em> assertions. <sup id="fnref-21"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap01/#fn-21">21</a></sup></p><p>Examples of <strong>factual assertions</strong> are ‚Äúglobal fossil-fuel burning emits 34 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year;‚Äù and ‚Äúif CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations are doubled then average temperatures will increase by 1.5‚Äì5.8¬∞C in the next 100 years;‚Äù and ‚Äúa temperature rise of 2¬∞C would cause the Greenland ice cap to melt within 500 years;‚Äù and ‚Äúthe complete melting of the Greenland ice cap would cause a 7-metre sea-level rise.‚Äù</p><p>A factual assertion is either true or false; Ô¨Åguring out <em>which</em> may be difÔ¨Åcult; it is a scientiÔ¨Åc question. For example, the assertions I just gave are either true or false. But we don‚Äôt know whether they are all true. Some of them are currently judged ‚Äúvery likely.‚Äù The difÔ¨Åculty of deciding which factual assertions are true leads to debates in the scientiÔ¨Åc community.

It is not a verbatim quote: I edited his words to make them briefer but took care not to correct any of his errors. <em>All three numbers he mentions are incorrect</em>. Here‚Äôs how he screwed up. First, he says ‚Äúcarbon dioxide‚Äù but gives numbers for carbon: the burning of fossil fuels sends <em>26</em> gigatonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> per year into the atmosphere (not 7 gigatonnes). A common mistake. Second, he claims that the oceans send 36000 gigatonnes of carbon per year into the atmosphere. This is a far worse error: 36000 gigatonnes is the <em>total amount</em> of carbon in the ocean<!-- -->!<!-- --> The annual <em>Ô¨Çow</em> is much smaller ‚Äì about 90 gigatonnes of carbon per year (330 GtCO<sub>2</sub>/y), according to standard diagrams of the carbon cycle [<a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 " href="http://tinyurl.com/l6y5g"><span class="websitetitle">l6y5g</span></a>] (I believe this 90 GtC/y is the estimated Ô¨Çow rate, were the atmosphere suddenly to have its CO<sub>2</sub> concentration reduced to zero.)

The correct Ô¨Ågure according to the standard diagrams is about 120 gigatonnes of carbon per year (440 Gt CO<sub>2</sub>/y).<a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-backref" href="/without-hot-air/chap01/#fnref-13">‚Ü©</a></li><li id="fn-14"><em><span id="Carbon">Carbon dioxide</span> has a warming effect</em>.

(1979). This report‚Äôs conclusions carry weight because the National Academy of Sciences (the US equivalent of the Royal Society) commissioned the report and selected its authors on the basis of their expertise, ‚Äúand with regard for appropriate balance.‚Äù The study group was convened ‚Äúunder the auspices of the Climate Research Board of the National Research Council to assess the scientiÔ¨Åc basis for projection of possible future climatic changes resulting from man-made releases of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.‚Äù SpeciÔ¨Åcally, they were asked: ‚Äúto identify the principal premises on which our current understanding of the question is based, to assess quantitatively the adequacy and uncertainty of our knowledge of these factors and processes, and to summarize in concise and objective terms our best present understanding of the carbon dioxide/climate issue for the beneÔ¨Åt of policy-makers.‚Äù The report is just 33 pages long, it is free to download [<a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 " href="http://tinyurl.com/5qfkaw"><span class="websitetitle">5qfkaw</span></a>], and I recommend it. It makes clear which bits of the science were already settled in 1979, and which bits still had uncertainty. Here are the main points I picked up from this report. First, doubling the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration would change the net heating of the troposphere, oceans, and land by an average power per unit area of roughly 4 W/m<sup>2</sup>, if all other properties of the atmosphere remained unchanged. This heating effect can be compared with the average power absorbed by the atmosphere, land, and oceans, which is 238 W/m<sup>2</sup>. So doubling CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations would have a warming effect equivalent to increasing the intensity of the sun by 4/238 = 1.7%. Second, the consequences of this CO<sub>2</sub>-induced heating are hard to predict, on account of the complexity of the atmosphere/ocean system, but the authors predicted a global surface warming of between 2¬∞C and 3.5¬∞C, with greater increases at high latitudes. Finally, the authors summarize: ‚Äúwe have tried but have been unable to Ô¨Ånd any overlooked or underestimated physical effects that could reduce the currently estimated global warmings due to a doubling of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> to negligible proportions or reverse them altogether.‚Äù They warn that, thanks to the ocean, ‚Äúthe great and ponderous Ô¨Çywheel of the global climate system,‚Äù it is quite possible that the warming would occur sufÔ¨Åciently sluggishly that it would be difÔ¨Åcult to detect in the coming decades. Nevertheless ‚Äúwarming will eventually occur, and the associated regional climatic changes ‚Ä¶ may well be signiÔ¨Åcant.‚Äù The foreword by the chairman of the Climate Research Board, Verner E. Suomi, summarizes the conclusions with a famous cascade of double negatives. ‚ÄúIf carbon dioxide continues to increase, the study group Ô¨Ånds no reason to doubt that climate changes will result and no reason to believe that these changes will be negligible.‚Äù<a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-backref" href="/without-hot-air/chap01/#fnref-14">‚Ü©</a></li><li id="fn-15"><em>The litany of probable drastic effects of climate change ‚Äì I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard it before</em>.

(1979). This report\\u2019s conclusions carry weight because the National Academy of Sciences (the US equivalent of the Royal Society) commissioned the report and selected its authors on the basis of their expertise, \\u201Cand with regard for appropriate balance.\\u201D The study group was convened \\u201Cunder the auspices of the Climate Research Board of the National Research Council to assess the scienti\\uFB01c basis for projection of possible future climatic changes resulting from man-made releases of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\\u201D Speci\\uFB01cally, they were asked: \\u201Cto identify the principal premises on which our current understanding of the question is based, to assess quantitatively the adequacy and uncertainty of our knowledge of these factors and processes, and to summarize in concise and objective terms our best present understanding of the carbon dioxide/climate issue for the bene\\uFB01t of policy-makers.\\u201D The report is just 33 pages long, it is free to download [\",mdx(\"a\",e({parentName:\"li\"},{href:\"http://tinyurl.com/5qfkaw\"}),mdx(\"span\",{class:\"websitetitle\"},\"5qfkaw\")),\"], and I recommend it. It makes clear which bits of the science were already settled in 1979, and which bits still had uncertainty. Here are the main points I picked up from this report. First, doubling the atmospheric CO\",mdx(\"sub\",null,\"2\"),\" concentration would change the net heating of the troposphere, oceans, and land by an average power per unit area of roughly 4 W/m\",mdx(\"sup\",null,\"2\"),\", if all other properties of the atmosphere remained unchanged. This heating effect can be compared with the average power absorbed by the atmosphere, land, and oceans, which is 238 W/m\",mdx(\"sup\",null,\"2\"),\". So doubling CO\",mdx(\"sub\",null,\"2\"),\" concentrations would have a warming effect equivalent to increasing the intensity of the sun by 4/238 = 1.7%. Second, the consequences of this CO\",mdx(\"sub\",null,\"2\"),\"-induced heating are hard to predict, on account of the complexity of the atmosphere/ocean system, but the authors predicted a global surface warming of between 2\\xB0C and 3.5\\xB0C, with greater increases at high latitudes. Finally, the authors summarize: \\u201Cwe have tried but have been unable to \\uFB01nd any overlooked or underestimated physical effects that could reduce the currently estimated global warmings due to a doubling of atmospheric CO\",mdx(\"sub\",null,\"2\"),\" to negligible proportions or reverse them altogether.\\u201D They warn that, thanks to the ocean, \\u201Cthe great and ponderous \\uFB02ywheel of the global climate system,\\u201D it is quite possible that the warming would occur suf\\uFB01ciently sluggishly that it would be dif\\uFB01cult to detect in the coming decades. Nevertheless \\u201Cwarming will eventually occur, and the associated regional climatic changes \\u2026 may well be signi\\uFB01cant.\\u201D The foreword by the chairman of the Climate Research Board, Verner E. Suomi, summarizes the conclusions with a famous cascade of double negatives. \\u201CIf carbon dioxide continues to increase, the study group \\uFB01nds no reason to doubt that climate changes will result and no reason to believe that these changes will be negligible.\\u201D\",mdx(\"a\",e({parentName:\"li\"},{href:\"#fnref-14\",className:\"footnote-backref\"}),\"\\u21A9\")),mdx(\"li\",e({parentName:\"ol\"},{id:\"fn-15\"}),mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"li\"},\"The litany of probable drastic effects of climate change \\u2013 I\\u2019m sure you\\u2019ve heard it before\"),\".
