Assumptions: electricity costs 10p per kWh; replacement traditional bulbs cost 45p each; energy-saving bulbs cost ¬£9. (I know you can find them cheaper than this, but this graph shows that even at ¬£9, they‚Äôre much more economical.)<p>In some countries, drivers must switch their lights on whenever their car is moving. How does the extra power required by that policy compare with the power already being used to trundle the car around? Let‚Äôs say the car has four incandescent lights totalling 100 W. The electricity for those bulbs is supplied by a 25%-efficient engine powering a 55%-efficient generator, <sup id="fnref-4"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap09/#fn-4">4</a></sup> so the power required is 730 W.

Osram‚Äôs 20 W low-energy bulb claims the same light output as a 100 W incandescent bulb. Moreover, its lifetime is said to be 15 000 hours (or ‚Äú12 years,‚Äù at 3 hours per day). In contrast a typical incandescent bulb might last 1000 hours. So during a 12-year period, you have this choice (figure 9.3): buy 15 incandescent bulbs and 1500 kWh of electricity (which costs roughly ¬£150); or buy one low-energy bulb and 300 kWh of electricity (which costs roughly ¬£30).</p><h4 id="should-i-wait-until-the-old-bulb-dies-before-replacing-it">Should I wait until the old bulb dies before replacing it?</h4><p>It feels like a waste, doesn‚Äôt it? Someone put resources into making the old incandescent lightbulb; shouldn‚Äôt we cash in that original investment by using the bulb until it‚Äôs worn out? But the economic answer is clear: <em>continuing to use an old lightbulb is throwing good money after bad</em>. If you can find a satisfactory low-energy replacement, replace the old bulb now.</p><h4 id="what-about-the-mercury-in-compact-fluorescent-lights-are-led-bulbs-better-than-fluorescents">What about the mercury in compact fluorescent lights? Are LED bulbs better than fluorescents?</h4><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure69.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 9.4</span>. Philips 11 W alongside Omicron 1.3 W LED bulb.<p>Researchers say that LED (light-emitting diode) bulbs will soon be even more energy-efficient than compact fluorescent lights. The efficiency of a light is measured in <em>lumens per watt</em>. I checked the numbers on my latest purchases: the Philips Genie 11 W compact fluorescent bulb (figure 9.4) has a brightness of 600 lumens, which is an efficiency of <strong>55 lumens per watt</strong>; regular incandescent bulbs deliver <strong>10 lumens per watt</strong>; the Omicron 1.3 W lamp, which has 20 white LEDs hiding inside it, has a brightness of 46 lumens, which is an efficiency of <strong>35 lumens per watt</strong>. So this LED bulb is almost as efficient as the fluorescent bulb. The LED industry still has a little catching up to do. In its favour, the LED bulb has a life of 50 000 hours, eight times the life of the fluorescent bulb. As I write, I see that <a class="jsx-1614200154 " href="http://www.cree.com"><span class="websitetitle">www.cree.com</span></a> is selling LEDs with a power of <strong>100 lumens per watt</strong>.

I expect that within another couple of years, the best advice, from the point of view of both energy efficiency and avoiding mercury pollution, will be to use LED bulbs.</p><h3 id="mythconceptions">Mythconceptions</h3><h4 id="there-is-no-point-in-my-switching-to-energy-saving-lights-the-wasted-energy-they-put-out-heats-my-home-so-its-not-wasted">‚ÄúThere is no point in my switching to energy-saving lights.

So during a 12-year period, you have this choice (figure 9.3): buy 15 incandescent bulbs and 1500 kWh of electricity (which costs roughly \\xA3150); or buy one low-energy bulb and 300 kWh of electricity (which costs roughly \\xA330).\"),mdx(\"h4\",e({},{id:\"should-i-wait-until-the-old-bulb-dies-before-replacing-it\"}),\"Should I wait until the old bulb dies before replacing it?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"It feels like a waste, doesn\\u2019t it? Someone put resources into making the old incandescent lightbulb; shouldn\\u2019t we cash in that original investment by using the bulb until it\\u2019s worn out? But the economic answer is clear: \",mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"continuing to use an old lightbulb is throwing good money after bad\"),\".

Philips 11 W alongside Omicron 1.3 W LED bulb.\",mdx(\"p\",null,\"Researchers say that LED (light-emitting diode) bulbs will soon be even more energy-efficient than compact fluorescent lights. The efficiency of a light is measured in \",mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"lumens per watt\"),\". I checked the numbers on my latest purchases: the Philips Genie 11 W compact fluorescent bulb (figure 9.4) has a brightness of 600 lumens, which is an efficiency of \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"55 lumens per watt\"),\"; regular incandescent bulbs deliver \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"10 lumens per watt\"),\"; the Omicron 1.3 W lamp, which has 20 white LEDs hiding inside it, has a brightness of 46 lumens, which is an efficiency of \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"35 lumens per watt\"),\". So this LED bulb is almost as efficient as the fluorescent bulb. The LED industry still has a little catching up to do. In its favour, the LED bulb has a life of 50 000 hours, eight times the life of the fluorescent bulb. As I write, I see that \",mdx(\"a\",e({parentName:\"p\"},{href:\"http://www.cree.com\"}),mdx(\"span\",{class:\"websitetitle\"},\"www.cree.com\")),\" is selling LEDs with a power of \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"100 lumens per watt\"),\".
