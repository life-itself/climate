Selfridges‚Äô rubbish advertisement.<h1 id="15-stuff">15 Stuff</h1><p>One of the main sinks of energy in the ‚Äúdeveloped‚Äù world is the creation of stuff. In its natural life cycle, stuff passes through three stages. First, a new-born stuff is displayed in shiny packaging on a shelf in a shop. At this stage, stuff is called ‚Äúgoods.‚Äù As soon as the stuff is taken home and sheds its packaging, it undergoes a transformation from ‚Äúgoods‚Äù to its second form, ‚Äúclutter.‚Äù The clutter lives with its owner for a period of months or years. During this period, the clutter is largely ignored by its owner, who is off at the shops buying more goods. Eventually, by a miracle of modern alchemy, the clutter is transformed into its final form, rubbish. To the untrained eye, it can be difficult to distinguish this ‚Äúrubbish‚Äù from the highly desirable ‚Äúgood‚Äù that it used to be. Nonetheless, at this stage the discerning owner pays the dustman to transport the stuff away.</p><p>Let‚Äôs say we want to understand the full energy-cost of a stuff, perhaps with a view to designing better stuff. This is called life-cycle analysis. It‚Äôs conventional to chop the energy-cost of anything from a hair-dryer to a cruise-ship into four chunks:</p><p>embodied energy (kWh per kg)</p><p>fossil fuel</p><p>10</p><p>wood</p><p>5</p><p>paper</p><p>10</p><p>glass</p><p>7</p><p>PET plastic</p><p>30</p><p>aluminium</p><p>40</p><p>steel</p><p>6</p><span class="figurenumber">Table 15.2</span>. Embodied energy of materials.<ul><li><strong>Phase R:</strong> Making <strong>raw materials</strong>.
This phase involves digging minerals out of the ground, melting them, purifying them, and modifying them into manufacturers‚Äô lego: plastics, glasses, metals, and ceramics, for example. The energy costs of this phase include the transportation costs of trundling the raw materials to their next destination.</li><li><strong>Phase P: Production</strong>.
In this phase, the raw materials are processed into a manufactured product. The factory where the hair-dryer‚Äôs coils are wound, its graceful lines moulded, and its components carefully snapped together, uses heat and light. The energy costs of this phase include packaging and more transportation.</li><li><strong>Phase U: Use</strong>.
Hair-dryers and cruise-ships both guzzle energy when they‚Äôre used as intended.</li><li><strong>Phase D: Disposal</strong>.
This phase includes the energy cost of putting the stuff back in a hole in the ground (landfill), or of turning the stuff back into raw materials (recycling); and of cleaning up all the pollution associated with the stuff.</li></ul><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure413.gif"/> <img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure106.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 15.3</span>.

She‚Äôs making chips. Photo: ABB. Making one personal computer every two years costs 2.5 kWh per day.<p>To understand how much energy a stuff‚Äôs life requires, we should estimate the energy costs of all four phases and add them up. Usually one of these four phases dominates the total energy cost, so to get a reasonable estimate of the total energy cost we need accurate estimates only of the cost of that dominant phase. If we wish to redesign a stuff so as to reduce its total energy cost, we should usually focus on reducing the cost of the dominant phase, while making sure that energy-savings in that phase aren‚Äôt being undone by accompanying increases in the energy costs of the other three phases.</p><p>Rather than estimating in detail how much power the perpetual production and transport of all stuff requires, let‚Äôs first cover just a few common examples: drink containers, computers, batteries, junk mail, cars, and houses. This chapter focuses on the energy costs of phases R and P. These energy costs are sometimes called the ‚Äúembodied‚Äù or ‚Äúembedded‚Äù energy of the stuff ‚Äì slightly confusing names, since usually that energy is neither literally embodied nor embedded in the stuff.</p><h3 id="drink-containers">Drink containers</h3><p>Let‚Äôs assume you have a coke habit: you drink five cans of multinational chemicals per day, and throw the aluminium cans away. For this stuff, it‚Äôs the raw material phase that dominates. The production of metals is energy intensive, especially for aluminium. Making one aluminium drinks-can needs 0.6 kWh. <sup id="fnref-1"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap15/#fn-1">1</a></sup> So a five-a-day habit wastes energy at a rate of <span class="red">3 kWh/d</span>.</p><p>As for a 500 ml water bottle made of PET (which weighs 25 g), the embodied energy is 0.7 kWh <sup id="fnref-2"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap15/#fn-2">2</a></sup> ‚Äì just as bad as an aluminium can<!-- -->!</p><h3 id="other-packaging">Other packaging</h3><p>The average Brit throws away 400 g of packaging per day <sup id="fnref-3"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap15/#fn-3">3</a></sup> ‚Äì mainly food packaging.

Assuming we replace each house every 100 years, the estimated energy cost is 2.3 kWh/d. This is the energy cost of creating the <em>shell</em> of the house only ‚Äì the foundation, bricks, tiles, and roof beams. If the average house occupancy is 2.3, the average energy expenditure on house building is thus estimated to be <span class="red">1 kWh per day per person</span>.</p><p>What about a <span id="car">car</span>, and a road?

A life-cycle analysis by Treloar, Love, and Crawford estimates that building an Australian road costs 7600 kWh per metre (a continuously reinforced concrete road), and that, including maintenance costs, the total cost over 40 years was 35 000 kWh per metre. Let‚Äôs turn this into a ballpark figure for the energy cost of British roads. There are 28 000 miles of trunk roads and class-1 roads in Britain (excluding motorways). Assuming 35 000 kWh per metre per 40 years, those roads cost us <span class="red">2 kWh/d per person</span>.</p><h3 id="transporting-the-stuff">Transporting the stuff</h3><p>Up till now I‚Äôve tried to make estimates of <em>personal</em> consumption. ‚ÄúIf you chuck away five coke-cans, that‚Äôs 3 kWh; if you buy <span class="red">The Independent</span>, that‚Äôs 2 kWh.‚Äù From here on, however, things are going to get a bit less personal.

But there‚Äôs talk of creating desalination plants in London. What‚Äôs the energy cost of turning salt water into drinking water? The least energy-intensive method is reverse osmosis. Take a membrane that lets through only water, put salt water on one side of it, and pressurize the salt water. Water reluctantly oozes through the membrane, producing purer water ‚Äì reluctantly, because pure water separated from salt has low entropy, and nature prefers high entropy states where everything is mixed up. We must pay high-grade energy to achieve unmixing.</p><p>The Island of Jersey has a desalination plant that can produce 6000 m<sup>3</sup> of pure water per day (figure 15.10). Including the pumps for bringing the water up from the sea and through a series of filters, the whole plant uses a power of 2 MW. That‚Äôs an energy cost of 8 kWh per m<sup>3</sup> of water produced.

Britain used to make its own gizmos, and our per-capita footprint in 1910 was as big as America‚Äôs is today. Now Britain doesn‚Äôt manufacture so much (so our energy consumption and carbon emissions have dropped a bit), but we still love gizmos, and we get them made for us by other countries. Should we ignore the energy cost of making the gizmo, because it‚Äôs imported? I don‚Äôt think so. Dieter Helm and his colleagues in Oxford estimate that under a correct account, allowing for imports and exports, Britain‚Äôs carbon footprint is nearly <em>doubled</em> from the official ‚Äú11 tons CO<sub>2</sub>e per person‚Äù to about 21 tons. This implies that the biggest item in the average British person‚Äôs energy footprint is the energy cost of making imported stuff. <sup id="fnref-15"><a class="jsx-1614200154 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap15/#fn-15">15</a></sup></p><p>In Chapter H, I explore this idea further, by looking at the weight of Britain‚Äôs imports. Leaving aside our imports of fuels, we import a little over 2 tons per person of stuff every year, of which about 1.3 tons per person are processed and manufactured stuff like vehicles, machinery, white goods, and electrical and electronic equipment. That‚Äôs about 4 kg per day per person of processed stuff. Such goods are mainly made of materials whose production required at least 10 kWh of energy per kg of stuff. I thus estimate that this pile of cars, fridges, microwaves, computers, photocopiers and televisions has an embodied energy of at least 40 kWh per day per person.</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure114.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 15.11</span>.
