look, feel or performance that owners have come to expect.</em></p><p>California Air Resources Board</p></blockquote><p>Roughly one third of our energy goes into transportation. Can <em>technology</em> deliver a reduction in consumption? In this chapter we explore options for achieving two goals: to deliver the biggest possible reduction in transport‚Äôs energy use, <em>and</em> to eliminate fossil fuel use in transport.</p><p>Transport featured in three of our consumption chapters: Chapter 3 (cars), Chapter 5 (planes), and Chapter 15 (road freight and sea freight). So there are two sorts of transport to address: passenger transport, and freight. Our unit of passenger transport is the passenger-kilometre (p-km). If a car carries one person a distance of 100 km, it delivers 100 p-km of transportation. If it carries four people the same distance, it has delivered 400 p-km. Similarly our unit of freight transport is the ton-km (t-km). If a truck carries 5 t of cargo a distance of 100 km then it has delivered 500 t-km of freight-transport. We‚Äôll measure the energy consumption of passenger transport in ‚ÄúkWh per 100 passenger-kilometres,‚Äù and the energy consumption of freight in ‚ÄúkWh per ton-km.‚Äù Notice that these measures are the other way up compared to ‚Äúmiles per gallon‚Äù: whereas we like vehicles to deliver <em>many</em> miles per gallon, we want energy-consumption to be <em>few</em> kWh per 100 p-km.</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure134.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 20.1.</span> This chapter‚Äôs starting point: an urban luxury tractor. The average UK car has a fuel consumption of 33 miles per gallon, which corresponds to an energy consumption of <span class="mauve">80 kWh per 100 km</span>. Can we do better?<p>We‚Äôll start this chapter by discussing how to reduce the energy consumption of surface transport. To understand how to reduce energy consumption, we need to understand where the energy is going in surface transport. Here are the three key concepts, which are explained in more detail in Technical Chapter A.</p><ol><li><p>In <em>short-distance travel</em> with lots of starting and stopping, the energy mainly goes into speeding up the vehicle and its contents. Key strategies for consuming less in this sort of transportation are therefore to <em>weigh less</em>, and to <em>go further between stops</em>. Regenerative braking, which captures energy when slowing down, may help too. In addition, it helps to <em>move slower</em>, and to <em>move less</em>.</p></li><li><p>In <em>long-distance travel</em> at steady speed, by train or automobile, most of the energy goes into making air swirl around, because you only have to accelerate the vehicle once. The key strategies for consuming less in this sort of transportation are therefore to <em>move slower</em>, and to <em>move less</em>, and to <em>use long, thin vehicles</em>.</p></li><li><p>In all forms of travel, there‚Äôs an energy-conversion chain, which takes energy in some sort of fuel and uses some of it to push the vehicle forwards. Inevitably this energy chain has inefficiencies. In a standard fossil-fuel car, for example, only 25% is used for pushing, and roughly 75% of the energy is lost in making the engine and radiator hot. So a final strategy for consuming less energy is to make the energy-conversion chain more efficient.</p></li></ol><p>These observations lead us to six principles of vehicle design and vehicle use for more-efficient surface transport: <em>a)</em> reduce the frontal area per person; <em>b)</em> reduce the vehicle‚Äôs weight per person; <em>c)</em> when travelling, go at a steady speed and avoid using brakes; <em>d)</em> travel more slowly; <em>e)</em> travel less; and <em>f)</em> make the energy chain more efficient. We‚Äôll now discuss a variety of ways to apply these principles.</p><h2 id="how-to-roll-better">How to roll better</h2><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure137.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 20.2.</span> Team Crocodile‚Äôs eco-car uses <span class="mauve">1.3 kWh per 100 km</span>.

[^3]<p>A widely quoted statistic says something along the lines of ‚Äúonly <em>1 percent</em> of the energy used by a car goes into moving the driver‚Äù <sup id="fnref-1"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap20/#fn-1">1</a></sup> ‚Äì the implication being that, surely, by being a bit smarter, we could make cars <em>100</em> times more efficient? The answer is yes, almost, but only by applying the principles of vehicle design and vehicle use, listed above, to <em>extreme</em> degrees.</p><p>One illustration of extreme vehicle design is an eco-car, which has small frontal area and low weight, and ‚Äì if any records are to be broken ‚Äì is carefully driven at a low and steady speed. The <em>Team Crocodile</em> eco-car (figure 20.2) does 2184 miles per gallon (1.3 kWh per 100 km) at a speed of 15 mph (24 km/h). Weighing 50 kg and shorter in height than a traffic cone, it comfortably accommodates one teenage driver.</p><p>Hmm. I think that the driver of the urban tractor in figure 20.1 might detect a change in ‚Äúlook, feel and performance‚Äù if we switched them to the eco-car and instructed them to keep their speed below 15 miles per hour. So, the idea that cars could easily be 100 times more energy efficient is a myth. We‚Äôll come back to the challenge of making energy-efficient cars in a moment. But first, let‚Äôs see some other ways of satisfying the principles of more-efficient surface transport.</p><p>Figure 20.3 shows a multi-passenger vehicle that is at least 25 times more energy-efficient than a standard petrol car: a bicycle. The bicycle‚Äôs performance (in terms of energy per distance) is about the same as the ecocar‚Äôs. <sup id="fnref-2"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap20/#fn-2">2</a></sup> Its speed is the same, its mass is lower than the eco-car‚Äôs (because the human replaces the fuel tank and engine), and its effective frontal area is higher, because the cyclist is not so well streamlined as the eco-car.</p><p>Figure 20.4 shows another possible replacement for the petrol car: a train, with an energy-cost, if full, of <span class="mauve">1.6 kWh per 100 passenger-km</span>. In contrast to the eco-car and the bicycle, trains manage to achieve outstanding efficiency without travelling slowly, and without having a low weight per person. Trains make up for their high speed and heavy frame by exploiting the principle of small frontal area per person. Whereas a cyclist and a regular car have effective frontal areas of about 0.8 m<sup>2</sup> and 0.5 m<sup>2</sup> respectively, a full commuter train from Cambridge to London has a frontal area per passenger of 0.02 m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>But whoops, now we‚Äôve broached an ugly topic ‚Äì the prospect of sharing a vehicle with ‚Äúall those horrible people.‚Äù Well, squish aboard, and let‚Äôs ask: How much could consumption be reduced by a switch from personal gas-guzzlers to excellent integrated public transport?</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure136.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 20.5.</span> Some public transports, and their energy-efficiencies, when on best behaviour.

If the trolleybus has 40 passengers on board, then its passenger transport cost is <span class="mauve">7 kWh per 100 p-km</span>. The Vancouver <strong>SeaBus</strong> has a transport cost of 83 kWh per vehicle-km at a speed of 13.5 km/h.

Three men and a cello ‚Äì the sole occupants of this carriage of the 10.30 high-speed train from Edinburgh to Kings Cross.<p>However, we must be realistic in our planning. Some trains, coaches, and buses are not full (figure 20.6). So the <em>average</em> energy cost of public transport is bigger than the best-case figures just mentioned. What‚Äôs the <em>average</em> energy-consumption of public transport systems, and what‚Äôs a realistic appraisal of how good they could be?</p><p>In 2006‚Äì7, the total energy cost of all London‚Äôs underground trains, including lighting, lifts, depots, and workshops, was <span class="mauve">15 kWh per 100 p-km</span> <sup id="fnref-6"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap20/#fn-6">6</a></sup> ‚Äì five times better than our baseline car. In 2006‚Äì7 the energy cost of all London buses was <span class="mauve">32 kWh per 100 p-km</span>. Energy cost is not the only thing that matters, of course. Passengers care about speed: and the underground trains delivered higher speeds (an average of 33 km/h) than buses (18 km/h). Managers care about financial costs: the staff costs, per passenger-km, of underground trains are less than those of buses.</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure140.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 20.7.</span> Some public transports, and their *average* energy consumptions.

Special parking privileges for electric cars in Ann Arbor, Michigan.<p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure146.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 20.11</span>. Monster cars are just tall enough to completely obscure the view and the visibility of pedestrians.<p>The energy consumption of individual cars can be reduced. The wide range of energy efficiencies of cars for sale proves this. In a single showroom in 2006 you could buy a Honda Civic 1.4 that uses roughly <span class="mauve">44 kWh per 100 km</span>, or a Honda NSX 3.2 that uses <span class="mauve">116 kWh per 100 km</span> (figure 20.9). The fact that people merrily <em>buy</em> from this wide range is also proof that we need extra incentives and legislation to encourage the blithe consumer to <em>choose</em> more energy-efficient cars. There are various ways to help consumers prefer the Honda Civic over the Honda NSX 3.2 gas-guzzler: raising the price of fuel; cranking up the showroom tax (the tax on new cars) in proportion to the predicted lifetime consumption of the vehicle; cranking up the road-tax on gas guzzlers; parking privileges for economical cars (figure 20.10); or fuel rationing. All such measures are unpopular with at least some voters. Perhaps a better legislative tactic would be to <em>enforce</em> reasonable energy-efficiency, rather than continuing to allow unconstrained choice; for example, we could simply <em>ban</em>, from a certain date, the sale of <em>any</em> car whose energy consumption is more than 80 kWh per 100 km; and then, over time, reduce this ceiling to 60 kWh per 100 km, then 40 kWh per 100 km, and beyond. Alternatively, to give the consumer more choice, regulations could force car manufacturers to reduce the <em>average</em> energy consumption of all the cars they sell. Additional legislation limiting the weight and frontal area of vehicles would simultaneously reduce fuel consumption and improve safety for other road-users (figure 20.11). People today choose their cars to make fashion statements. With strong efficiency legislation, there could still be a wide choice of fashions; they‚Äôd all just happen to be energy-efficient. You could choose any colour, as long as it was green.</p><p>While we wait for the voters and politicians to agree to legislate for efficient cars, what other options are available?</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure143.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 20.12</span>.

The priority rules are the same as those of a British roundabout, except that cars exiting the central circle must give way to circulating cyclists (just as British cars give way to pedestrians on zebra crossings). Where excellent cycling facilities are provided, people will use them, as evidenced by the infinite number of cycles sitting outside the Enschede railway station (figure 20.13).</p><p>Somehow, British cycle provision (figure 20.14) doesn‚Äôt live up to the Dutch standard.</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure144.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 20.14</span>.

A V¬¥elo‚Äôv station in Lyon.<p>In the French city of Lyon, a privately-run public bicycle network, V¬¥elo‚Äôv, was introduced in 2005 and has proved popular. Lyon‚Äôs population of 470 000 inhabitants is served by 2000 bikes distributed around 175 cycle-stations in an area of 50 km<sup>2</sup> (figure 20.15). In the city centre, you‚Äôre usually within 400 metres of a cycle-station. Users join the scheme by paying a subscription fee of ‚Ç¨10 per year and may then hire bicycles free for all trips lasting less than 30 minutes. For longer hire periods, users pay up to ‚Ç¨1 per hour. Short-term visitors to Lyon can buy one-week subscriptions for ‚Ç¨1.</p><h3 id="other-legislative-opportunities">Other legislative opportunities</h3><p>Speed limits are a simple knob that could be twiddled. As a rule, cars that travel slower use less energy (see Chapter A). With practice, drivers can learn to drive more economically: using the accelerator and brake less and always driving in the highest possible gear can give a 20% reduction in fuel consumption.</p><p><img src="/img/without-hot-air/figure149.gif"/></p><span class="figurenumber">Figure 20.16</span>. With congestion like this, it‚Äôs faster to walk.<p>Another way to reduce fuel consumption is to reduce congestion. Stopping and starting, speeding up and slowing down, is a much less efficient way to get around than driving smoothly. Idling in stationary traffic is an especially poor deliverer of miles per gallon<!-- -->!</p><p>Congestion occurs when there are too many vehicles on the roads. So one simple way to reduce congestion is to group travellers into fewer vehicles. A striking way to think about a switch from cars to coaches is to calculate the road area required by the two modes.

(Credit for this performance improvement must be shared between regenerative braking and the use of hybrid technology.) Hydraulics and flywheels are both promising ways to handle regenerative braking because small systems can handle large powers. A flywheel system weighing just 24 kg (figure 20.18), designed for energy storage in a racing car, can store 400 kJ (0.1 kWh) of energy ‚Äì enough energy to accelerate an ordinary car up to 60 miles per hour (97 km/h); and it can accept or deliver 60 kW of power.

The best result was 16 kWh per 100 km, and the worst was 33 kWh per 100 km.

If grid electricity has a carbon footprint of 500 g per kWh(e) then the effective emissions of this vehicle are <strong>100 g CO<sub>2</sub> per km</strong>, which is as good as the best fossil cars (figure 20.9).

From 1952 to 1968, the economical way to cross the Atlantic was in two Dutch-built liners known as ‚ÄúThe Economy Twins,‚Äù the Maasdam and the Rijndam. <sup id="fnref-23"><a class="jsx-b028de3a7ed822f8 footnote-ref" href="/without-hot-air/chap20/#fn-23">23</a></sup> These travelled at 16.5 knots (30.5 km/h), so the crossing from Britain to New York took eight days. Their energy consumption, if they carried a full load of 893 passengers, was 103 kWh per 100 p-km. At a typical 85% occupancy, the energy consumption was <span class="mauve">121 kWh per 100 pkm</span> ‚Äì more than twice that of the jumbo jet. To be fair to the boats, they are not only providing transportation: they also provide the passengers and crew with hot air, hot water, light, and entertainment for several days; but the energy saved back home from being cooped up on the boat is dwarfed by the boat‚Äôs energy consumption, which, in the case of the QE2, is about 3000 kWh per day per passenger.</p><p>So, sadly, I don‚Äôt think boats are going to beat planes in energy consumption. If eventually we want a way of travelling large distances without fossil fuels, perhaps nuclear-powered ships are an interesting option (figures 20.31 &amp; 20.32).</p><h2 id="what-about-freight">What about freight?</h2><p>International shipping is a surprisingly efficient user of fossil fuels; so getting road transport off fossil fuels is a higher priority than getting ships off fossil fuels. But fossil fuels are a finite resource, and eventually ships must be powered by something else. Biofuels <em>may</em> work out. Another option will be nuclear power. The first nuclear-powered ship for carrying cargo and passengers was the NS Savannah, launched in 1962 as part of President Dwight D. Eisenhower‚Äôs <em>Atoms for Peace</em> initiative (figure 20.31). Powered by one 74-MW nuclear reactor driving a 15-MW motor, the Savannah had a service speed of 21 knots (39 km/h) and could carry 60 passengers and 14000 t of cargo. That‚Äôs a cargo transport cost of 0.14 kWh per ton-km. She could travel 500 000 km without refuelling. There are already many nuclear-powered ships, both military and civilian. Russia has ten nuclear-powered ice-breakers, for example, of which seven are still active. Figure 20.32 shows the nuclear ice-breaker Yamal, which has two 171-MW reactors, and motors that can deliver 55 MW.</p><h2 id="hang-on-you-havent-mentioned-magnetic-levitation">‚ÄúHang on<!-- -->!<!-- --> You haven‚Äôt mentioned magnetic levitation‚Äù</h2><p>The German company, Transrapid, which made the maglev train for Shanghai, China (figure 20.33), says: ‚ÄúThe Transrapid Superspeed Maglev System is unrivaled when it comes to noise emission, energy consumption, and land use.

I learnt a brilliant way to automate congestion-charging from Stephen Salter. A simple daily congestion charge, as levied in London, sends only a crude signal to drivers; once a car-owner has decided to pay the day‚Äôs charge and drive into a congestion zone, he has no incentive to drive <em>little</em> in the zone. Nor is he rewarded with any rebate if he carefully chooses routes in the zone that are not congested. Instead of having a centralized authority that decides in advance when and where the congestion-charge zones are, with expensive and intrusive monitoring and recording of vehicle movements into and within all those zones, Salter has a simpler, decentralized, anonymous method of charging drivers for driving in heavy, slow traffic, wherever and whenever it actually exists. The system would operate nationwide. Here‚Äôs how it works. We want a device that answers the question ‚Äúhow congested is the traffic I am driving in?‚Äù A good measure of congestion is ‚Äúhow many other active vehicles are close to mine?‚Äù In fast-moving traffic, the spacing between vehicles is larger than slow-moving traffic. Traffic that‚Äôs trundling in tedious queues is the most densely packed. The number of nearby vehicles that are active can be sensed anonymously by fitting in every vehicle a radio transmitter/receiver (like a very cheap mobile phone) that transmits little radio-bleeps at a steady rate whenever the engine is running, and that counts the number of bleeps it hears from other vehicles. The congestion charge would be proportional to the number of bleeps received; this charge could be paid at refuelling stations whenever the vehicle is refuelled.

I learnt a brilliant way to automate congestion-charging from Stephen Salter. A simple daily congestion charge, as levied in London, sends only a crude signal to drivers; once a car-owner has decided to pay the day\\u2019s charge and drive into a congestion zone, he has no incentive to drive \",mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"li\"},\"little\"),\" in the zone. Nor is he rewarded with any rebate if he carefully chooses routes in the zone that are not congested. Instead of having a centralized authority that decides in advance when and where the congestion-charge zones are, with expensive and intrusive monitoring and recording of vehicle movements into and within all those zones, Salter has a simpler, decentralized, anonymous method of charging drivers for driving in heavy, slow traffic, wherever and whenever it actually exists. The system would operate nationwide. Here\\u2019s how it works. We want a device that answers the question \\u201Chow congested is the traffic I am driving in?\\u201D A good measure of congestion is \\u201Chow many other active vehicles are close to mine?\\u201D In fast-moving traffic, the spacing between vehicles is larger than slow-moving traffic. Traffic that\\u2019s trundling in tedious queues is the most densely packed. The number of nearby vehicles that are active can be sensed anonymously by fitting in every vehicle a radio transmitter/receiver (like a very cheap mobile phone) that transmits little radio-bleeps at a steady rate whenever the engine is running, and that counts the number of bleeps it hears from other vehicles. The congestion charge would be proportional to the number of bleeps received; this charge could be paid at refuelling stations whenever the vehicle is refuelled.
