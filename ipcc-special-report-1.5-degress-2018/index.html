Limiting global warming requires limiting the total cumulative global anthropogenic emissions of CO2 since the pre-industrial period, that is, staying within a total carbon budget (high confidence).By the end of 2017, anthropogenic CO2 emissions since the pre-industrial period are estimated to have reduced the total carbon budget for 1.5¬∞C by approximately 2200 ¬± 320 GtCO2 (medium confidence). The associated remaining budget is being depleted by current emissions of 42 ¬± 3 GtCO2 per year (high confidence). The choice of the measure of global temperature affects the estimated remaining carbon budget. Using global mean surface air temperature, as in AR5, gives an estimate of the remaining carbon budget of 580 GtCO2 for a 50% probability of limiting warming to 1.5¬∞C, and 420 GtCO2 for a 66% probability (medium confidence).Alternatively, using GMST gives estimates of 770 and 570 GtCO2, for 50% and 66% probabilities,respectively (medium confidence). Uncertainties in the size of these estimated remaining carbon budgets are substantial and depend on several factors. Uncertainties in the climate response to CO2 and non-CO2 emissions contribute ¬±400 GtCO2 and the level of historic warming contributes ¬±250 GtCO2 (medium confidence). Potential additional carbon release from future permafrost thawing and methane release from wetlands would reduce budgets by up to 100 GtCO2 over the course of this century and more thereafter (medium confidence). In addition, the level of non-CO2 mitigation in the future could alter the remaining carbon budget by 250 GtCO2 in either direction (medium confidence). {1.2.4, 2.2.2, 2.6.1, Table 2.2, Chapter 2 Supplementary Material}</p></blockquote><p>Certainty in output.

The urban and infrastructure system transition consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5¬∞C with no or limited overshoot would imply, for example, changes in land and urban planning practices, as well as deeper emissions reductions in transport and buildings compared to pathways that limit global warming below 2¬∞C (medium confidence).

CDR would be used to compensate for residual emissions and, in most cases, achieve net negative emissions to return global warming to 1.5¬∞C following a peak (high confidence). CDR deployment of several hundreds of GtCO2 is subject to multiple feasibility and sustainability constraints (high confidence). Significant near-term emissions reductions and measures to lower energy and land demand can limit CDR deployment to a few hundred GtCO2 without reliance on bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) (high confidence). {2.3, 2.4, 3.6.2, 4.3, 5.4}</p></blockquote><h3 id="however-there-are-major-feasibility-questions-on-cdr">However there are major feasibility questions on CDR</h3><p>From that previous paragraph:</p><blockquote><p>CDR deployment of several hundreds of GtCO2 is subject to multiple feasibility and sustainability constraints (high confidence).</p></blockquote><p>And later on ‚Ä¶</p><blockquote><p>C.3.4.

Pathways that limit global warming to 1.5¬∞C with no or limited overshoot show clear emission reductions by 2030 (high confidence). All but one show a decline in global greenhouse gas emissions to below 35 GtCO2eq yr‚àí1 in 2030, and half of available pathways fall within the 25‚Äì30 GtCO2eq yr‚àí1 range (interquartile range), a 40‚Äì50% reduction from 2010 levels (high confidence). Pathways reflecting current nationally stated mitigation ambition until 2030 are broadly consistent with cost-effective pathways that result in a global warming of about 3¬∞C by 2100, with warming continuing afterwards (medium confidence). {2.3.3, 2.3.5, Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4, 5.5.3.2}</p></blockquote><p>Wow, we are really in trouble.

Overshoot trajectories result in higher impacts and associated challenges compared to pathways that limit global warming to 1.5¬∞C with no or limited overshoot (high confidence).
